Following on from http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2010/07/11/a-new-found-respect-for-acceptance-tests/[my post about the value we found in acceptance tests on our project when doing a large scale refactoring] I had an interesting discussion with http://twitter.com/JakCharlton[Jak Charlton] and http://twitter.com/Ben_Hall[Ben Hall] about deleting unit tests when they're no longer needed.

The following is part of our discussion:

@JakCharlton @markhneedham a lot (not all) of the unit tests created can be deleted once the acceptance tests are passing\...

@Ben_Hall @markhneedham yep I agree, but that isn't what TDD really advocates - its a balance, unit tests work well in some places

@Ben_Hall @JakCharlton gotta be courageous to do that.Its like you're ripping away the safety net. Even if it might be an illusion of safety

While Jak and Ben are probably right I do *find myself feeling way more anxious about deleting test code than I would deleting production code*.

I think that this is mostly because when I delete production code we usually have some tests around that code so there is a degree of safety in doing so.

Deleting tests seems a bit more risky because there's *much more judgement involved* in working out whether we're removing the safety net that we created by writing those tests in the first place.

The diagram on the right hand side shows the way I see the various safety nets that we create to protect us from making breaking changes in production code.

In this case it might seem that a unit test is providing safety but it's now an illusion of safety and in actual fact it's barely protecting us at all.

I find it much easier to delete a unit test if it's an obvious duplicate or if we've completely changed the way a piece of code works such that the test will never pass again anyway...

..and I find it more difficult to judge when we end up with tests which overlap while testing similar bits of functionality.

Do others feel like this as well or am I just being overly paranoid?

Either way does anyone have any approaches that give you ore confidence that you're not deleting something that will come back to haunt you later?
