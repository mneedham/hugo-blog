Yesterday evening I decided to try and upgrade the Ruby installation on my Mac from 1.8.7 to 1.9.2 and went on the yak shaving mission which is doing just that.

http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/[RVM] seems to be the way to install Ruby these days so I started off by installing that with the following command from the terminal:

[source,text]
----

bash < <( curl http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/releases/rvm-install-head )
----

That bit worked fine for me but there are further instructions on the RVM website if that doesn't work.

My colleague http://www.ilovemartinfowler.com[David Santoro] pointed me to http://asciicasts.com/episodes/200-rails-3-beta-and-rvm[a post on ASCIIcasts detailing the various steps to follow to get Ruby installed].

Unfortunately my first attempt...

[source,text]
----

rvm install 1.9.2
----

...resulted in the following error in the log file:
[source,text]
----

yaml.h is missing. Please install libyaml.
readline.c: In function ‘username_completion_proc_call’:
readline.c:1292: error: ‘username_completion_function’ undeclared (first use in this function)
readline.c:1292: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once
readline.c:1292: error: for each function it appears in.)
make[1]: *** [readline.o] Error 1
make: *** [mkmain.sh] Error 1
----

I thought that perhaps 'libyaml' was the problem but http://michaelguterl.com/[Michael Guterl] pointed me to http://groups.google.com/group/rubyversionmanager/browse_thread/thread/364c2366f67c3d55[a post on the RVM mailing list] which suggests this was a red herring and that the real problem was 'readline'.

That led me back to http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/packages/readline/[a post on the RVM website which explains how to install 'readline' and then tell RVM to use that version of readline when installing Ruby].

I tried that and then ran the following command as suggested on Mark Turner's http://amerine.net/2010/02/24/rvm-rails3-ruby-1-9-2-setup.html[blog post]:

[source,text]
----

rvm install 1.9.2-head -C --enable-shared,--with-readline-dir=/opt/local,--build=x86_64-apple-darwin10
----

That resulted in this error:

[source,text]
----

ld: in /usr/local/lib/libxml2.2.dylib, file was built for i386 which is not the architecture being linked (x86_64)
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[1]: *** [../../.ext/x86_64-darwin10/tcltklib.bundle] Error 1
make: *** [mkmain.sh] Error 1
----

Michael pointed out that I needed to https://gist.github.com/dbaee0a06702f6441e0f[recompile 'libxml2.2' to run on a 64 bit O/S] as I'm running Snow Leopard.

I hadn't previously used the 'file' function which allows you to see which architecture a file has been compiled for.

e.g.

[source,text]
----

file /usr/local/lib/libxml2.2.dylib

/usr/local/lib/libxml2.2.dylib: Mach-O dynamically linked shared library i386
----

I had to recompile 'libxml2.2' to run on a 64 bit O/S which I did by downloading the distribution from the link:ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxml2/[xmlsoft website] and then running the following commands:

[source,text]
----

tar xzvf libxml2-2.7.3.tar.gz
cd libxml2-2.7.3
./configure --with-python=/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.3/
make
sudo make install
----

Re-running RVM Ruby installation command I then had this error instead:

[source,text]
----

tcltklib.c:9539: warning: implicit conversion shortens 64-bit value into a 32-bit value
ld: in /usr/local/lib/libsqlite3.dylib, file was built for i386 which is not the architecture being linked (x86_64)
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
make[1]: *** [../../.ext/x86_64-darwin10/tcltklib.bundle] Error 1
make: *** [mkmain.sh] Error 1
----

I downloaded the http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-amalgamation-3.6.23.1.tar.gz[sqlite3 distribution] and having untarred the file ran the following commands http://osdir.com/ml/sqlite-users/2010-05/msg00477.html[as detailed on this post]:

[source,text]
----

CFLAGS='-arch i686 -arch x86_64' LDFLAGS='-arch i686 -arch x86_64'
./configure --disable-dependency-tracking
make
sudo make install
----

Next I needed to recompiled 'libxslt' which I downloaded from the link:ftp://xmlsoft.org/libxslt/[xmlsoft website] as well before untarring it and running the following:

[source,text]
----

./configure
make
sudo make install
----

Having done that I re-ran the RVM Ruby installation command:

[source,text]
----

rvm install 1.9.2-head -C --enable-shared,--with-readline-dir=/opt/local,--build=x86_64-apple-darwin10
----

And it finally worked!
