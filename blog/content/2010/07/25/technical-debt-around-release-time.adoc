One of the requirements that the ThoughtWorks University grads have been given on the internal project they're working on is to ensure that they leave the code base in a good state so that the next batch can potentially continue from where they left off.

The application will be deployed on Thursday and this means that a lot of the time  this week will be spent refactoring certain areas of the code base rather than only adding new functionality.

When this was suggested http://dudadornelles.wordpress.com/[Duda] pointed out that it's often the case that we might accept a certain amount of technical debt in order to get the application out there.

While he is right and this is quite an unusual situation, we did see a similar situation on the last project I worked on.

On that project there was quite a tight delivery deadline for the first release so we knowingly incurred some technical debt in order to make sure that we met that date.

I've http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2010/06/20/coding-controlled-technical-debt/[written previously] http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2010/07/11/a-new-found-respect-for-acceptance-tests/[about some of the technical debt that we incurred] in that first release and while I think most of the time we made the right call I think there were still some occasions when we thought we were taking on http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html[deliberate prudent debt but were actually taking on deliberate imprudent debt].

Luckily it didn't really come back to bite us and in the second release we had a much more relaxed pace and were therefore able to go through the code base and refactor certain parts of it to make it more maintainable.

http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/testdrivendevelopment/message/33121[J.B. Rainsberger has a really cool analogy] about refactoring where he talks about *cleaning the kitchen* and *cleaning the garage*.

Cleaning the kitchen is what we endeavour to do all the time such that we'll write a bit of code and then clean up after ourselves. Sometimes we don't clean up enough and we end up with a bit of a mess which takes much longer to clean up - i.e. we need to clean the garage.

I think we sometimes drift towards thinking that we don't need to clean the kitchen so often and end up cleaning the garage too often as a result.

This is something that Uncle Bob covered in a post he wrote around a year ago where where http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/10/15/we-must-ship-now-and-deal-with-consequences[he points out that we're more likely to take on technical debt when we didn't need to rather than the other way around].

Finding the right balance between cleaning the kitchen and cleaning the garage seems to be something that comes from the experience of taking either approach too far.
