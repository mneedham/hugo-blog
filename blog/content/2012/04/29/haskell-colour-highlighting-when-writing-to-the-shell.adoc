title="Haskell: Colour highlighting when writing to the shell"
tag=['haskell']

I spent a few hours writing a simple front end on top of the http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2012/04/25/algorithms-rabin-karp-in-haskell/[Rabin Karp algorithm] so that I could show the line of the first occurrence of a pattern in a piece of text on the shell.

I thought it would be quite cool if I could highlight the appropriate text on the line http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/460[like how grep does] when the '--color=auto' flag is supplied.

We can make use of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code[ANSI escape codes] to do this.

We need to construct an escape sequence which starts with the 'ESC' character, represented by decimal value 27 or hexidecimal value 1b, followed by a left bracket ("["):

____
"\x1b[" or "\27["
____

In the second part of the sequence we can choose http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#CSI_codes[a variety of different options]. In this case we use the following:

____
CSI n [;k] m SGR -- Select Graphic Rendition Sets SGR parameters, including text color. After CSI can be zero or more parameters separated with ;. With no parameters, CSI m is treated as CSI 0 m (reset / normal), which is typical of most of the ANSI escape sequences.
____

To change the colour of the text we need to set 'k' to one of the following values:

* 30 - Black
* 31 - Red
* 32 - Green
* 33 - Yellow
* 34 - Blue
* 35 - Magenta
* 36 - Cyan
* 37 - White

For example, if we want to print all future text in green then we can use the following escape sequence:

[source,haskell]
----

> putStrLn $ "\x1b[32m"
----

Ideally we should then reset the terminal which means passing a 'k' value of 0.

So if we just want to highlight one word we'd end up with this:

[source,haskell]
----

> putStrLn $ "\x1b[32m" ++ "highlight me" ++ "\x1b[0m" ++ " but not me"
----
