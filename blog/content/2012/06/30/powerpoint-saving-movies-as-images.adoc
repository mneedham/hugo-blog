I've been working on a presentation for the ThoughtWorks Europe away day over the last few days and I created some screen casts using http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html[Camtasia] which I wanted to include.

It's reasonably easy to insert movies into Powerpoint but I was finding that when I saved the file and then reloaded it the movies had been converted into images which wasn't what I wanted at all!

Eventually I came across http://www.ehow.com/how_4500346_keep-embedded-video-powerpoint-after.html[a blog post which explained that I'd been saving the file as the wrong format].

I'd been saving it as a 'ppt' but what I actually needed was to save it as a 'ppsx':

I spent about an hour trying to work out what I was doing wrong, an hour I hopefully won't have to spend next time.
