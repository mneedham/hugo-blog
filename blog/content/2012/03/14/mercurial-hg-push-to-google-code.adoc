I wanted to make a change to add +++<cite>+++flatMap+++</cite>+++ to +++<cite>+++Option+++</cite>+++ in https://code.google.com/p/totallylazy/[totallylazy] so I had to https://code.google.com/r/mhneedham-totally-lazy/[clone the repository] and make the change.

I thought I'd then be able to just push the change using my Google user name and password but instead ended up with the following error:

[source,text]

It turns out that you need to specifically set an option to use your Google account from the https://code.google.com/hosting/settings[settings page]:

And then it works!
