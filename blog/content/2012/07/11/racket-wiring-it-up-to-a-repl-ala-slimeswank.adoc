title="Racket: Wiring it up to a REPL ala SLIME/Swank"
tag=['scheme']
category=['Software Development']
+++

One of the awesome things about working with clojure is that it's possible to wire up clojure files in emacs to a REPL by making use of http://www.beaconhill.com/solutions/kb/clojure/setting-up-clojure-with-slime-on-ubuntu.html[Slime]/https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure[Swank].

I've started using http://racket-lang.org/[Racket] to work through the examples in http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Little-Schemer-Daniel-Friedman/dp/0262560992/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1342034533&sr=8-1[The Little Schemer] and wanted to achieve a similar thing there.

____
Racket is a modern programming language in the Lisp/Scheme family, suitable for a wide range of applications

I don't know much about configuring emacs so I made use of Phil Halgelberg's https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit[emacs-starter-kit which is available on github].

On my travels I came across http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zev99LT-k70[this video describing how to do exactly what I wanted].

The first step was to download a library called 'http://www.nongnu.org/geiser/[geiser]':

____
Geiser is a generic Emacs/Scheme interaction mode, featuring an enhanced REPL and a set of minor modes improving Emacs' basic scheme major mode.

The easiest way seemed to be to clone the git repository:

[source,text]
----

git clone git://gitorious.org/geiser/mainline.git geiser
----

I then added the following line to my +++<cite>+++/Users/mneedham.emacs.d/init.el+++</cite>+++ file:

[source,text]
----

(load "/Users/mneedham/github/geiser/elisp/geiser.el")
----

From emacs you then need to run the following command:

[source,text]
----

M-x geiser
----

It then asks you which scheme implementation you want to use, so in our case we need to make sure that racket is available on the path.

For some reason when I downloaded racket it seemed to prefer mounting itself as a volume rather than installing itself to /Applications so I ended up copy/pasting the folder to my home directory and adding it to the PATH in my +++<cite>+++.bashrc+++</cite>+++:

[source,text]
----

export PATH=$PATH:"/Users/mneedham/Documents/Racket v5.2.1/bin"
----

Now we can just type 'racket' when we're asked which scheme implementation we want and then we're done!
