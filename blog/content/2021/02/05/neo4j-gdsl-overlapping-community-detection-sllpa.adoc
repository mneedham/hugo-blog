The https://neo4j.com/product/graph-data-science-library/[Neo4j Graph Data Science Library^] provides efficiently implemented, parallel versions of common graph algorithms for Neo4j, exposed as Cypher procedures.
It recently published the https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science/releases/tag/1.5.0-alpha04[preview release of version 1.5^], which introduces some fun new algorithms.

In this blog post we're going to explore the newly added https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/1.5-preview/algorithms/sllpa/[Speaker-Listener Label Propagation  algorithm^] with the help of a twitter dataset.

== Launching Neo4j

We're going to run Neo4j with the Graph Data Science Library using the following Docker Compose configuration:

.docker-compose.yml
[source,yaml]
----
version: '3.7'
services:
  neo4j:
    image: neo4j:4.2-enterprise
    container_name: "neo4j4.2-gds1.5-exploration"
    volumes:
      - ./plugins-4.2:/plugins
      - ./data-4.2:/data
    ports:
      - "7474:7474"
      - "7687:7687"
    environment:
      - NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT=yes
      - NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/neo

      # We can use the line below once GDS 1.5.0 is released
      # - NEO4JLABS_PLUGINS=["apoc", "graph-data-science"]

      # We can use the lines below until GDS 1.5.0 is released
      - NEO4JLABS_PLUGINS=["apoc"]
      - "NEO4J_dbms_security_procedures_unrestricted=apoc.*,gds.*"
----

If you want to follow along with the examples used in the blog post, you can copy the configuration above to a file titled `docker-compose.yml`

[NOTE]
====
Until GDS 1.5.0 is released we'll need to manually put the preview jar for the GDS plugin into the `plugins-4.2` directory.
We can https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science/releases/download/1.5.0-alpha04/neo4j-graph-data-science-1.5.0-alpha04.jar[download the file from GitHub releases^].
====

We can now launch the Neo4j server by running the following command:

[source, bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

After we've launched that command, we need to wait until we see the following output:

.Output
[source,text]
