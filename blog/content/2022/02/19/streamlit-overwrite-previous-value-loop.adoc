I was recently building a Streamlit app in which I was looping through a stream of values and wanted to only print out the most recent value.
In this blog post we'll learn how to do that.

.Streamlit: Overwrite previous value in a loop

== Setup

If you want to play along you'll need to create a virtual environment and install Streamlit:

[source, bash]
----
python -m  venv env
source venv/bin/activate
pip install streamlit
----

== Streamlit App

Now, create a file `app.py` that contains the following:

.app.py
[source, python]
----
import streamlit as st

st.markdown("#### Numbers one after the other")
for i in range(0,10):
  st.write(i)
----

And run the following command from the terminal:

[source, bash]
----
streamlit run app.py
----

If we run this command it will open a web browser at http://localhost:8501, and we'll see the following output:

.Numbers one after the other
image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2022/02/numbers-one-after-the-other.png[width="300px"]

The numbers are all printed out, which isn't exactly what we want.
In this example we're only printing out 10 numbers, but if we had a bigger stream of values it would eventually crash the browser!

Instead we can use a single element container (https://docs.streamlit.io/library/api-reference/layout/st.empty[`st.empty`]) and populate that on each loop.
Let's update `app.py` to look like this:

.app.py
[source, python]
----
import streamlit as st

left, right = st.columns(2)

with left:
  st.markdown("#### Numbers one after the other")
  for i in range(0,10):
    st.write(i)

with right:
  st.markdown("#### Numbers overwriting each other")
  numbers = st.empty()

  for i in range(0,10):
    with numbers.container():
      st.write(i)
----

Now if we go back to our Streamlit app, we'll see the following:

.Numbers overwriting each other
image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2022/02/numbers-overwriting-each-other.png[width="600px"]

We can only see the number 9 because that's the last value that got printed.

If we want to see how the output progresses, we'll need to pause the loop for a little bit after each iteration.
Update `app.py` to look like this:

.app.py
[source, python]
----
import streamlit as st
import time

left, right = st.columns(2)

with left:
  st.markdown("#### Numbers one after the other")
  for i in range(0,10):
    st.write(i)

with right:
  st.markdown("#### Numbers overwriting each other")
  numbers = st.empty()

  for i in range(0,10):
    with numbers.container():
      st.write(i)
      time.sleep(0.5)
----

And now if we refresh the page, we'll see it update like this:

.Numbers overwriting each other animation

Exactly what I wanted - good work Streamlit!
