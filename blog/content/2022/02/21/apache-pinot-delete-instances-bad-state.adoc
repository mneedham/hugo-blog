Sometimes when I start up a local Pinot cluster after doing a hard shutdown (by restarting my computer) I noticed that the Pinot Data Explorer shows controllers, brokers, or servers in a bad state.
In this blog post we'll see how to get rid of those bad instances.

The screenshot below shows several instances in the bad state.

I'm not entirely sure why this happens, but I assume it's something to do with my local IP address changing as far as Pinot's concerned.
Having these instances in a bad state doesn't actually cause me any problems, they're more of an irritation.

Luckily we can get rid of that irritation with help from the REST API's drop instance endpoint, shown in the screen shot below:

.Drop instance endpoint

So, what does calling this end point actually do? 
I had a quick look at the code and learnt that it deletes the following Zookeeper entries:

* `INSTANCES/<instanceName>`
* `/CONFIGS/PARTICIPANT/<instanceName>`

We can see an example of what that part of our Zookeeper metadata looks like below:

.Zookeeper meta

We want to remove the following instances:

* Controller_172.21.0.4_9000
* Controller_172.21.0.2_9000
* Controller_172.21.0.5_9000
* Server_172.21.0.3_8098
* Server_172.21.0.4_8098
* Broker_172.21.0.3_8099



[source, bash]

  printf "\n"

We can return the ideal state for the `brokerResource` by running the following command:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/zk/get?path=%2FPinotCluster%2FIDEALSTATES%2FbrokerResource" \
  -H "accept: text/plain" 2>/dev/null

    "IDEAL_STATE_MODE" : "CUSTOMIZED",
    "NUM_PARTITIONS" : "3",
    "REBALANCE_MODE" : "CUSTOMIZED",
    "REPLICAS" : "0",
    "STATE_MODEL_DEF_REF" : "BrokerResourceOnlineOfflineStateModel",
    "STATE_MODEL_FACTORY_NAME" : "DEFAULT"
  },
  "mapFields" : {
    "courses_OFFLINE" : {
      "Broker_172.21.0.3_8099" : "ONLINE",
      "Broker_172.21.0.5_8099" : "ONLINE"
    },
    "parkrun_REALTIME" : {
      "Broker_172.21.0.3_8099" : "ONLINE",
      "Broker_172.21.0.5_8099" : "ONLINE"
    },
    "races_REALTIME" : {
      "Broker_172.21.0.3_8099" : "ONLINE",
      "Broker_172.21.0.5_8099" : "ONLINE"
    }
  },
  "listFields" : { }
}
----

Let's create a file, `newBrokerState.json`, that removes the `Broker_172.21.0.3_8099` entry.
The file should look like this:

.newBrokerState.json
[source, json]
----
include::content/2022/02/21/newBrokerState.json[]
----

Now navigate to the Zookeeper browser at http://localhost:9000/#/zookeeper and navigate down to `Pinot Cluster -> IDEALSTATES -> brokerResource`.
Click on the edit button, paste in this JSON document, and click *Update*.

And now let's do the same thing for `races_REALTIME`. 
The ideal state at the moment looks like this:

[source, bash]
----
curl -X GET "http://localhost:9000/zk/get?path=%2FPinotCluster%2FIDEALSTATES%2Fraces_REALTIME" \
  -H "accept: text/plain" 2>/dev/null
----

.Output
[source, json]
----

  "id" : "races_REALTIME",
  "simpleFields" : {
    "BATCH_MESSAGE_MODE" : "false",
    "IDEAL_STATE_MODE" : "CUSTOMIZED",
    "INSTANCE_GROUP_TAG" : "races_REALTIME",
    "MAX_PARTITIONS_PER_INSTANCE" : "1",
    "NUM_PARTITIONS" : "11",

  },
  "mapFields" : {
    "races__0__0__20220127T1647Z" : {
      "Server_172.21.0.6_8098" : "ONLINE"
    },
    "races__0__10__20220218T1304Z" : {
      "Server_172.21.0.4_8098" : "CONSUMING"
    },
    "races__0__1__20220202T1635Z" : {
      "Server_172.21.0.6_8098" : "ONLINE"
    },
    "races__0__2__20220203T1636Z" : {
      "Server_172.21.0.6_8098" : "ONLINE"
    },
    "races__0__3__20220209T1442Z" : {
      "Server_172.21.0.6_8098" : "ONLINE"
    },
    "races__0__4__20220210T1442Z" : {
      "Server_172.21.0.6_8098" : "ONLINE"
    },
    "races__0__5__20220212T1807Z" : {
      "Server_172.21.0.6_8098" : "ONLINE"
    },
    "races__0__6__20220214T1304Z" : {
      "Server_172.21.0.6_8098" : "ONLINE"
    },
    "races__0__7__20220215T1304Z" : {
      "Server_172.21.0.6_8098" : "ONLINE"
    },
    "races__0__8__20220216T1304Z" : {
      "Server_172.21.0.6_8098" : "ONLINE"
    },
    "races__0__9__20220217T1304Z" : {
      "Server_172.21.0.6_8098" : "ONLINE"
    }
  },
  "listFields" : { }
}
----

And now let's replace `Server_172.21.0.4_8098` with `Server_172.21.0.6_8098` for the consuming segment.

.newServerState.json
[source, json]
----
include::content/2022/02/21/newServerState.json[]
----

We'll update that node in Zookeeper the same way that we did with the `brokerResource`, and now we can re-run our command to delete these two instances:

[source, bash]
----
for instance in "Controller_172.21.0.4_9000" "Controller_172.21.0.2_9000" "Controller_172.21.0.5_9000" "Server_172.21.0.3_8098" "Server_172.21.0.4_8098" "Broker_172.21.0.3_8099"; do
  curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:9000/instances/${instance}" \
    -H "accept: application/json" 2>/dev/null;
  printf "\n"
done
----

.Output
[source, json]
----
{"_code":404,"_error":"Instance Controller_172.21.0.4_9000 not found"}
{"_code":404,"_error":"Instance Controller_172.21.0.2_9000 not found"}
{"_code":404,"_error":"Instance Controller_172.21.0.5_9000 not found"}
{"_code":404,"_error":"Instance Server_172.21.0.3_8098 not found"}
{"status":"Successfully dropped instance"}
{"status":"Successfully dropped instance"}
----

The first 4 instances return a 404 status since we've already deleted them, but the last two have now been deleted!

Now if we navigate back to the home page of the Pinot Data Explorer, we'll see that there are no bad instances anymore:
