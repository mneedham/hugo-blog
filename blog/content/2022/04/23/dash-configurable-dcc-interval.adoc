As I mentioned in my blog post about https://www.startree.ai/blogs/building-real-time-crypto-dashboard-pinot-dash[building a Real-Time Crypto Dashboard^], I've recently been working with the https://dash.plotly.com/[Dash^] low-code framework for building interactive data apps.

I was using the https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components/interval[`dcc.Interval`^] component to automatically refresh components on the page and wanted to make the refresh interval configurable.
In this blog post we'll learn how to do that.

== Setup

Let's first setup our Python environment:

[source, bash]
----
python -m venv .env
source .env/bin/activate
----

And install the dash library:

[source, bash]
----
pip install dash
----

== Building a refreshing dashboard

Now we're going to build a simple dashboard that refreshes a timestamp on the page once every 1,000 milliseconds i.e. once per second.
The code to do this is shown below:

.dashboard.py
[source, python]
----
include::content/2022/04/23/dashboard.py[]
----

[source, bash]
----
python dashboard.py
----

If we navigate to http://localhost:8050, we'll see the timestamp updating once per second, as shown in the following animation:

.Refreshing every second

The timestamp updates once every second, just as we'd expect.

To make this value configurable we will use `dcc.Slider` to set the new refresh rate and we'll add a new callback that updates the refresh interval.

.dashboard.py
[source, python]
----
include::content/2022/04/23/dashboard2.py[]
----
<1> `dcc.Slider` lets us configure a new refresh rate
<2> This callback updates the value of `interval-component`

Now if we navigate back to our web browser, we can adjust the interval to be whatever we like:

.Refreshing at different intervals
