As I continue to build an Apache Pinot demo using https://docs.cryptowat.ch/rest-api/[CryptoWatch^] data, I found myself needing to optimise some queries so that the real-time dashboard would render more quickly.
I did this using https://docs.pinot.apache.org/users/user-guide-query/filtering-with-idset[IdSets^] and in this blog post we'll learn about those and how to use them.

== Pinot Schema

For the purpose of this blog post we don't need to know how to configure the Pinot schema and tables, but we do need to know that we're working with `trades` and `pairs` tables, whose schemas are shown below:

.trades and pairs schemas
image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2022/04/trades-pairs.png[]

* `trades` is a real-time table that streams data in from a CryptoWatch live stream via a Kafka topic. 
* `pairs` is a offline dimension table that contains look up data of the available currency pairs used by CryptoWatch

`pairs` has `id` as its primary key and we'll be using Pinot's https://dev.startree.ai/docs/pinot/recipes/lookup-joins[lookup join functionality^] to return the human friendly quotes and bases referred to by the `currencyPairId`.

## Querying pairs

From our dashboard we want to return the trades for a give base and quote. 
A base is the asset being purchased and a quote is that asset used to buy it.

So to find all the matching rows for buying Bitcoin with US Dollars, we'd write the following query:

[source, sql]
----
select count(*) 
FROM pairs
WHERE baseName = 'Bitcoin' 
AND quoteName = 'United States Dollar'
----

.Results
[options="header"]
|===
|count(*)
|286
|===

From the output we learn that there are 286 different currency pairs representing the purchase of Bitcoin using US Dollars.

## Lookup join of pairs and trades

Now let's say we want to find all the trades of Bitcoin using US Dollars. 
We might write the following query:

[source, sql]
----
select avg(price) AS avgPrice, max(price) as maxPrice, min(price) AS minPrice, 
        count(*) AS count, sum(amount) AS amountTraded
from trades 
WHERE lookUp('pairs', 'baseName', 'id', currencyPairId) = 'Bitcoin'
AND lookUp('pairs', 'quoteName', 'id', currencyPairId) = 'United States Dollar'
----

If we run this query and look at the query stats for this query, we see the following:

.Query Stats
[source, json]
----
{
  "numServersQueried": 1,
  "numServersResponded": 1,
  "numSegmentsQueried": 37,
  "numSegmentsProcessed": 37,
  "numSegmentsMatched": 37,
  "numConsumingSegmentsQueried": 1,
  "numDocsScanned": 310757,
  "numEntriesScannedInFilter": 32212707,
  "numEntriesScannedPostFilter": 621514,
  "numGroupsLimitReached": false,
  "totalDocs": 16155043,
  "timeUsedMs": 440
}
----

I ran this query a few times and it takes between 380ms - 700ms each time.
It's not an ideal query because we're having to call the `lookUp` function twice per row to check whether it matches the base and quote name.

Another approach to finding the matching trades would be to first query the `pairs` table, get all the matching ids, and then use those ids as part of a `WHERE currencyPairId IN ()` clause in a query against the `trades` table.
It does seem a bit clunky though.

== Querying with IdSets

Enter the https://docs.pinot.apache.org/users/user-guide-query/filtering-with-idset[IdSet^]!

IdSets are compressed representations of a set of values. 
For ints Pinot uses a RoaringBitmap, for longs a Roaring64NavigableMap, and for other types a Bloom Filter. 

The simplest way to generate an IdSet is to use the `ID_SET` function, as shown below:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT ID_SET(id) 
FROM pairs 
WHERE baseName = 'Bitcoin' 
AND quoteName = 'United States Dollar'
----

++++
<style>
table td {
    overflow-wrap: anywhere;
}
</style>
++++

.Results
[options="header"]
|===
|idset(id)

We could then use this value to query the `trades` table, like this:

[source, sql]
----
select avg(price) AS avgPrice, max(price) as maxPrice, min(price) AS minPrice, 
        count(*) AS count, sum(amount) AS amountTraded
from trades 
WHERE IN_ID_SET(
    currencyPairId,

) = 1   
----

The query stats for this query are shown below:

.Query Stats
[source, json]
----
{
  "numServersQueried": 1,
  "numServersResponded": 1,
  "numSegmentsQueried": 38,
  "numSegmentsProcessed": 37,
  "numSegmentsMatched": 37,
  "numConsumingSegmentsQueried": 1,
  "numDocsScanned": 310757,
  "numEntriesScannedInFilter": 16155043,
  "numEntriesScannedPostFilter": 621514,
  "numGroupsLimitReached": false,
  "totalDocs": 16155043,
  "timeUsedMs": 125
}
----

This is about 3x faster than our original query - a pretty good improvement!
It's still a bit annoying though as we need to pass in that really long string value representing all the ids.

Luckily Pinot lets us write sub queries for IdSets, using the `IN_SUBQUERY` function, as shown below:

[source, sql]
----
select avg(price) AS avgPrice, max(price) as maxPrice, min(price) AS minPrice, 
        count(*) AS count, sum(amount) AS amountTraded
from trades 
WHERE IN_SUBQUERY(
  currencyPairId, 
  'SELECT ID_SET(id) 
   FROM pairs 
   WHERE baseName = ''Bitcoin'' 
   AND quoteName = ''United States Dollar'''
) = 1
----

We can see the query stats from running this query below:

.Query Stats
[source, json]
----
{
  "numServersQueried": 1,
  "numServersResponded": 1,
  "numSegmentsQueried": 38,
  "numSegmentsProcessed": 37,
  "numSegmentsMatched": 37,
  "numConsumingSegmentsQueried": 1,
  "numDocsScanned": 310757,
  "numEntriesScannedInFilter": 16155043,
  "numEntriesScannedPostFilter": 621514,
  "numGroupsLimitReached": false,
  "totalDocs": 16155043,
  "timeUsedMs": 132
}
