We're deploying the StarTree developer site, https://dev.startree.ai/[dev.startree.ai^], to Vercel, and recently needed to do some redirects of a few pages.
I initially added https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/redirects[individual redirects^] for each page, but there were eventually too many pages and I wanted to automate it.
In this post we'll learn how to do that.

.Vercel: Redirect wildcard (nested) paths
image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2022/07/vercel-nested-paths-banner.png[]

We wanted to redirect everything under https://dev.startree.ai/docs/thirdeye to https://dev.startree.ai/docs/startree-enterprise-edition/startree-thirdeye/ and started off by using wild card path matching, as seen in the `vercel.json` file below:

.vercel.json
[source, json]
----
{
    "redirects": [
      { 
        "source": "/docs/thirdeye/:path*",
        "destination": "/docs/startree-enterprise-edition/startree-thirdeye/:path*", 
        "permanent": true
      }
    ]
}
----

This worked for the top level paths and even ones nested to several levels, like https://dev.startree.ai/docs/thirdeye/concepts/root-cause-analysis:

[source, bash]
----
wget -S https://dev.startree.ai/docs/thirdeye/concepts/root-cause-analysis
----

.Output
[source, text]

I thought this was gonna be the solution, but then I checked a URL that had a trailing slash and the redirection didn't work anymore:

[source, bash]
----
wget -S https://dev.startree.ai/docs/thirdeye/concepts/root-cause-analysis/
----

.Output
[source, text]
----

  HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
----

A bit of searching led me to this https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/24288[GitHub issue^], which suggested that I needed to use the https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next.config.js/rewrites#regex-path-matching[regex path matching^] syntax instead of wildcard path matching.

I updated my vercel.json file to look like this:

.vercel.json
[source, json]
----
{
    "redirects": [
      { 
        "source": "/docs/thirdeye/:path(.*)",
        "destination": "/docs/startree-enterprise-edition/startree-thirdeye/:path", 
        "permanent": true
      }
    ]
}
----

And now if we try to access the page with the trailing slash again:

[source, bash]
----
wget -S https://dev.startree.ai/docs/thirdeye/concepts/root-cause-analysis/
----

.Output
[source, text]
