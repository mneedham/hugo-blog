grid-template-columns one column fixed split the rest equally

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-columns



<flex>
Is a non-negative dimension with the unit fr specifying the track's flex factor. Each <flex>-sized track takes a share of the remaining space in proportion to its flex factor.

When appearing outside a minmax() notation, it implies an automatic minimum (i.e. minmax(auto, <flex>)).
