I've been working with Docusaurus to build the https://dev.startree.ai/[dev.startree.ai] website over the last few months and I wanted to add https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages[a custom page^] with a sidebar similar to the one that gets automatically generated on documentation pages. 

All the examples I could find showed you to create a splash page, so it took me a while to figure out how to do what I wanted, but in this post we'll learn how to do it.

.Docusaurus: Side menu on custom page

First, let's create a Docusaurus site called `my-website` by running the following command:

[source, bash]
----
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
----

We can run the site locally with the following command:


[source, bash]
----
npm run start
----

This will run a local webserver at http://localhost:3000, which will show the following page:

.Docusaurus

Custom pages go under `src/pages` and whatever we name our file will be the name of the page. 
Let's create `myCustomPage.js` with the following contents:

.src/pages/myCustomPage.js
[source, js,indent=2]
----
include::content/2022/07/11/myCustomPage.js[]
----

If we want to adjust the items show in the side bar we'd need to change the `DocSidebar` component's `sidebar` property. 
Most of the code shown here describes CSS styles that do change location between minor versions.
I'll try to keep the example up to date with the latest version.

[NOTE]
====
The version of the docusaurus at the time of writing this blog post is 2.0.0-beta.22.
====

The custom page is created at http://localhost:3000/myCustomPage and looks like this:

.Docusaurus Custom Page
