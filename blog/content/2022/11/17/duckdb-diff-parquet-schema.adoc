I've been playing around with DuckDB, the https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/15/motherduck-secures-investment-from-andreessen-horowitz-to-commercialize-duckdb/[new hotness^] in the analytics space, over the last month, and my friend Michael Hunger asked whether you could use it to compute a diff of Apache Parquet schemas.

Challenge accepted!

## Querying the Parqeut Schema

Let's say we have three Parquet files that represent ATP tennis players - `players1.parquet`, `players2.parquet`, and `players3.parquet`.
We can get the list of column names along with their data type and file name by running the following query in the https://duckdb.org/docs/api/cli.html[DuckDB CLI^]:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT file_name, name, type
FROM parquet_schema('players*.parquet')
ORDER BY file_name;
----

If we run this query, we'll see the following results:


.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
|      file_name | name  | type
| players1.parquet | duckdb_schema | BOOLEAN    
| players1.parquet | player_id     | INT32      
| players1.parquet | name_first    | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players1.parquet | name_last     | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players1.parquet | hand          | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players1.parquet | dob           | INT32      
| players1.parquet | ioc           | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players1.parquet | height        | INT32      
| players1.parquet | wikidata_id   | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players2.parquet | duckdb_schema | BOOLEAN    
| players2.parquet | player_id     | INT32      
| players2.parquet | first_name    | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players2.parquet | last_name     | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players2.parquet | hand          | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players2.parquet | dob           | INT32      
| players2.parquet | ioc           | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players2.parquet | height        | INT32      
| players2.parquet | wikidata_id   | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players3.parquet | duckdb_schema | BOOLEAN    
| players3.parquet | player_id     | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players3.parquet | first_name    | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players3.parquet | last_name     | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players3.parquet | hand          | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players3.parquet | dob           | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players3.parquet | ioc           | BYTE_ARRAY 
| players3.parquet | height        | BYTE_ARRAY 
|===

From scanning this list, we can see that there are some differences in the schemas, but it's not entirely obvious what those differences are.
Let's see if we can write some queries to figure it out.

## Temporary Tables

But first, we're going to create a temporary table per schema file to simplify the queries that we have to write.
Temporary tables are stored in memory for the current session and will be gone should be exit the DuckDB CLI.

The following code creates the temporary tables:

[source, sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP TABLE p1Schema AS 
SELECT * FROM parquet_schema('players1.parquet');

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP TABLE p2Schema AS 
SELECT * FROM parquet_schema('players2.parquet');

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP TABLE p3Schema AS 
SELECT * FROM parquet_schema('players3.parquet');
----

## Missing fields

Now we're going to write a query that finds the fields that are in p1Schema, but not in p2Schema.
We'll use SQL's `EXCEPT` clause to do this:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT name, type FROM p1Schema
EXCEPT
SELECT name, type FROM p2Schema;
----

If we run this query, we'll see the following results:

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
|      name | type
| name_first | BYTE_ARRAY
| name_last  | BYTE_ARRAY
|===

There are a couple of fields missing in `p2Schema` that are in `p1Schema`.
Let's now run the inverse query to discover fields that are in `p2Schema`, but not in `p1Schema`:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT name, type FROM p2Schema
EXCEPT
SELECT name, type FROM p1Schema;
----

The results are as follows:

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
|      name | type
| first_name | BYTE_ARRAY
| last_name  | BYTE_ARRAY
|===

It looks like we did some basic field renaming between these two schemas!
Let's put both those queries together, along with a description that explains what's going on for missing column:

[source, sql]
----
WITH schema1 AS (
    SELECT name, type FROM p1Schema
), schema2 AS (
    SELECT name, type FROM p2Schema
), notInSchema1 AS (
    SELECT * FROM schema1 EXCEPT SELECT * FROM schema2
), notInSchema2 AS (
    SELECT * FROM  schema2 EXCEPT SELECT * FROM schema1
)

SELECT *, 'Missing in players2.parquet' AS description
FROM notInSchema1
UNION ALL 
SELECT *, 'Missing in players1.parquet' AS description
FROM notInSchema2;
----

If we run this query, we'll see this outpu

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
|      name | type | description
| name_first | BYTE_ARRAY | Missing in players2.parquet 
| name_last  | BYTE_ARRAY | Missing in players2.parquet 
| first_name | BYTE_ARRAY | Missing in players1.parquet 
| last_name  | BYTE_ARRAY | Missing in players1.parquet 
|===

Now we can clearly see that the first two fields are missing in `players2.parquet` and the latter ones are missing in `players1.parquet`.

How about if we do the same thing for `p2Schema` and `p3Schema`?

[source, sql]
----
WITH schema1 AS (
    SELECT name, type FROM p2Schema
), schema2 AS (
    SELECT name, type FROM p3Schema
), notInSchema1 AS (
    SELECT * FROM schema1 EXCEPT SELECT * FROM schema2
), notInSchema2 AS (
    SELECT * FROM  schema2 EXCEPT SELECT * FROM schema1
)

SELECT *, 'Missing in players3.parquet' AS description
FROM notInSchema1
UNION ALL 
SELECT *, 'Missing in players2.parquet' AS description
FROM notInSchema2;
----

And let's run tha

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
|      name | type | description
| player_id   | INT32      | Missing in players3.parquet 
| dob         | INT32      | Missing in players3.parquet 
| height      | INT32      | Missing in players3.parquet 
| wikidata_id | BYTE_ARRAY | Missing in players3.parquet 
| player_id   | BYTE_ARRAY | Missing in players2.parquet 
| dob         | BYTE_ARRAY | Missing in players2.parquet 
| height      | BYTE_ARRAY | Missing in players2.parquet 
|===

`wikidata_id` is missing in players3.parquet, but the other 3 fields are clearly in both schemas, so why are they showing up?!
It turns out they have a different data type in each schema.

## Same columns, different type

To return an easier to read representation of schemas that have the same fields/columns, with different types, we can write the following query:

[source, sql]
----

    SELECT schema1.name AS s1Name, schema1.type AS s1Type, schema2.type AS s2Type, 
        schema1.file_name AS s1File, schema2.file_name AS s2File
    FROM p2Schema AS schema1
    INNER JOIN p3Schema AS schema2 ON schema2.name = schema1.name
    WHERE s1Type <> s2Type;


----

And let's see those results...

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
|  s1Name   | s1Type |   s2Type   |      s1File      |      s2File      
| player_id | INT32  | BYTE_ARRAY | players2.parquet | players3.parquet 
| dob       | INT32  | BYTE_ARRAY | players2.parquet | players3.parquet 
| height    | INT32  | BYTE_ARRAY | players2.parquet | players3.parquet 
|===

## Conclusion

It turns out that computing Parquet schema diffs is another thing that DuckDB is really good at!
So give it a try the next time you have some mismatched schemas, but you don't know exactly what's not matching!
