As I mentioned in my last blog post, I've been working on an https://dev.startree.ai/docs/pinot/recipes/[Apache Pinot recipe^] showing how to ingest data from S3 and after I'd got that working I moved onto using the https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/components/minion#segmentgenerationandpushtask[SegmentGenerationAndPushTask^] to poll S3 and ingest files automatically.

It took me longer than it should have to get this working and hopefully this blog post will help you avoid the problems that I had.

.Apache Pinot: Skipping periodic task: Task: PinotTaskManager

We're gonna start with a Docker Compose file that spins up Zookeeper and a Pinot Controller, as shown below:

.docker-compose.yml
[source, yaml]
----
version: '3.7'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: zookeeper:3.5.6
    hostname: zookeeper
    container_name: zookeeper
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000
  pinot-controller:
    image: apachepinot/pinot:0.10.0
    command: "StartController -zkAddress zookeeper:2181"
    container_name: "pinot-controller"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./input:/input
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
----

We can run this by using the `docker-compose up` command.
Once we've done that we're going to create an `events` table that ingests files from S3 once a minute.
The config for this table is shown below:

./config/table.json
[source, json]
----
{
    "tableName": "events",
    "tableType": "OFFLINE",
    "segmentsConfig": {
        "timeColumnName": "ts",
        "schemaName": "events",
        "replication": "1"
    },
    "tableIndexConfig": {
        "loadMode": "MMAP"
    },
    "tenants": {},
    "metadata": {},
    "ingestionConfig": {
        "batchIngestionConfig": {
            "segmentIngestionType": "APPEND",
            "segmentIngestionFrequency": "DAILY",
            "batchConfigMaps": [
                {
                    "input.fs.className": "org.apache.pinot.plugin.filesystem.S3PinotFS",
                    "input.fs.prop.region": "eu-west-2",
                    "input.fs.prop.accessKey": "<access-key>",
                    "input.fs.prop.secretKey": "<secret-key>",
                    "inputDirURI": "s3://<bucket-name>",
                    "includeFileNamePattern": "glob:**/*.json",
                    "excludeFileNamePattern": "glob:**/*.tmp",
                    "inputFormat": "json"
                }
            ]
        }
    },
    "task": {
        "taskTypeConfigsMap": {
            "SegmentGenerationAndPushTask": {
                "schedule": "0 */1 * * * ?",
                "tableMaxNumTasks": 10
            }
        }
    }
}
----

I created this table using the following command:

[source, bash]
----
docker exec -it pinot-controller bin/pinot-admin.sh AddTable   \
  -tableConfigFile /config/table.json   \
  -schemaFile /config/schema.json -exec
----

I then waited for the JSON documents to be ingested.
After a few minutes of not seeing any data in my Pinot table, I started debugging to figure out what was going on.
The `SegmentGenerationAndPushTask` is configured by the `PinotTaskManager`, so I looked for any mentions of that class in the Pinot controller logs:

[source, bash]
----
docker exec -it pinot-controller grep -rni --color "PinotTaskManager" logs/ 
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
logs/pinot-all.log:4055:2022/06/20 09:14:38.608 INFO [PeriodicTaskScheduler] [main] Skipping periodic task: Task: PinotTaskManager, Interval: -1s, Initial Delay: 272s
----

Hmmm, the periodic task that would schedule our import job is being ignored, which explains why no data is being ingested.
It took me a while to figure out that the task scheduler is disabled by default, and needs to be enabled in the Controller configuration, as shown below:

./config/controller-conf.conf
[source, text]
----
controller.access.protocols.http.port=9000
controller.zk.str=zookeeper:2181
controller.helix.cluster.name=PinotCluster
controller.host=pinot-controller
controller.port=9000

controller.task.scheduler.enabled=true
controller.task.frequencyPeriod=5m
----

If we're using Docker, we need to update the command for starting the Pinot Controller to refer to that configuration file, as shown below:

[source, yaml]
----
version: '3.7'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: zookeeper:3.5.6
    hostname: zookeeper
    container_name: zookeeper
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000
  pinot-controller:
    image: apachepinot/pinot:0.10.0
    command: "StartController -zkAddress zookeeper:2181 -config /config/controller-conf.conf"
    container_name: "pinot-controller"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./input:/input
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
----

And once we've restarted that container, we can search the logs again:

[source, bash]
----
docker exec -it pinot-controller grep -rni --color "PinotTaskManager" logs/ 
----


.Output
[source,text]
----
2022/06/23 11:08:34.181 INFO [PeriodicTaskScheduler] [main] Starting periodic task scheduler with tasks: [Task: PinotTaskManager, Interval: 300s, Initial Delay: 280s, Task: RetentionManager, Interval: 21600s, Initial Delay: 183s, Task: OfflineSegmentIntervalChecker, Interval: 86400s, Initial Delay: 215s, Task: RealtimeSegmentValidationManager, Interval: 3600s, Initial Delay: 242s, Task: BrokerResourceValidationManager, Interval: 3600s, Initial Delay: 210s, Task: SegmentStatusChecker, Interval: 300s, Initial Delay: 219s, Task: SegmentRelocator, Interval: 3600s, Initial Delay: 229s, Task: MinionInstancesCleanupTask, Interval: 3600s, Initial Delay: 206s, Task: TaskMetricsEmitter, Interval: 300s, Initial Delay: 263s]
----

Success!
Now the `PinotTaskManager` is running and will schedule `SegmentGenerationAndPushTask` as expected.
