Recently I've been playing around with geometry objects in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text_representation_of_geometry[WKT format^] while documenting https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/indexing/geospatial-support[Apache Pinot's Geospatial functions^].
I then wanted to figure out how to generate a WKT string from a list of lat long coordinates, which we'll learn how to do in this blog post.  

.Python: Generate WKT from Lat Long Coordinates

We're going to do all this using Python's https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html[Shapely^] library, so let's first install that library:

[source, bash]
----
pip install shapely
----

[NOTE]
====
I learnt about the Shapely library from https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/294206/create-a-polygon-from-coordinates-in-geopandas-with-python[Davma's StackOverflow question^].
====

Let's say we have a bunch of lat/long coordinates defined like this:

[source, python]
----
lat_longs = [
    (50.854457, 4.377184), 
    (52.518172, 13.407759), 
    (50.072651, 14.435935), 
    (48.853033, 2.349553), 
    (50.854457, 4.377184)
]
----

We're going to create a polygon based on these coordinates using the following code:

[source, python]
----
from shapely.geometry import Polygon
polygon = Polygon(lat_longs)
----

And getting a WKT string is as easy as calling the `wkt` property:

[source, python]
----
print(polygon.wkt)
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
POLYGON ((50.854457 4.377184, 52.518172 13.407759, 50.072651 14.435935, 48.853033 2.349553, 50.854457 4.377184))
----

And finally, we can plot that polygon on a map using the https://clydedacruz.github.io/openstreetmap-wkt-playground/[OpenStreetMap WKT Playground^].
