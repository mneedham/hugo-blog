I've been working with https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/tag/strava/[Strava^] data again recently and wanted to extract all the lat/long coordinates recorded for my runs.
Having done this, I realised that my running watch hadn't recorded as many points as I expected, so I needed to interpolate the missing points.
In this blog post we'll learn how to do that.

== Setup

Let's first install a few libraries that we'll be using:

[source, bash]
----
pip install stravalib pandas pyproj
----

Once we've installed those library, let's import them into our Python script:

[source, python]
----
import pickle
import time
import pandas as pd
from datetime import timedelta
----

== Creating the Strava client

First we'll need to create a Strava client using the stravalib library.
This involves generating an access token, which I showed how to do in my blog post titled https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2020/12/20/strava-export-all-activities-json/[Strava: Export all activities to JSON file].

We'll assume that's already been done and the client has been serialised to `auth/client.pkl`.
We can load the client by running the following code:


[source, python]
----
def load_object(filename):
    with open(filename, 'rb') as input:
        loaded_object = pickle.load(input)
        return loaded_object

client = load_object('auth/client.pkl')
----

== Exporting lat/long points

Now that we've got that setup, it's time to export those lat/long points
We'll use https://www.strava.com/activities/3092741860[one of my runs^] from my trip to Sweden for the Neo4j Engineering Offsite in February 2020, back in the good old pre-Covid days.

We can get the lat/long points for an activity from the https://pythonhosted.org/stravalib/api.html#stravalib.client.Client.get_activity_streams[get_activity_streams^] function, as shown in the following code sample:

[source, python]
----
id = 3092741860

response = client.get_activity(id)
start = response.start_date

response = client.get_activity_streams(id, ["distance", "latlng", "time", "heartrate", "cadence", "altitude"])
latlong = response["latlng"].data
time_list = response["time"].data
altitude = response["altitude"].data
hr = response["heartrate"].data if response.get("heartrate") else 0
cadence = response["cadence"].data if response.get("cadence") else 0

data = pd.DataFrame([*latlong], columns=['lat','lon'])
data["id"] = id
data["distance"] = response["distance"].data
data['altitude'] = altitude
data['hr'] = hr
data['cadence'] = cadence
data['time'] = [(start+timedelta(seconds=t)) for t in time_list]
data['rawTime'] = time_list

data.to_csv("points.csv", index=False)
----

Below are the first few lines of this file:

.points.csv
[format="csv", options="header", cols="10,10,10,10,10,10,10,20,10"]
|===
include::content/2022/01/18/data/points.csv[lines=1..6]
|===

There are 914 points over 86 minutes, or just over 10 points per minute.
I want to have one point per second, or around 5,160 points for this activity.

== Interpolating points

To achieve this we're going to generate/interpolate the missing points.
We can do this by computing equally spaced lat/long coordinates in between the points that we do have using the https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/[Pyproj library^].

[NOTE]
====
I learnt about the Pyproj library from https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/311362/interpolating-orthodrome-between-two-lon-lat-points-in-python[Felix's StackOverflow answer^].
====

Let's learn how to use the library on a couple of the lat/longs from the dataset. 
We'll have the https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/api/geod.html?highlight=npts#pyproj.Geod.npts[`npts`^] function compute two points in between the provided points:

[source, python]
----
from pyproj import Geod

geoid = Geod(ellps="WGS84")

point1 = (56.434604, 12.838070)
point2 = (56.434625, 12.838106)
points_to_generate = 2

extra_points = geoid.npts(point1[0], point1[1], point2[0], point2[1], points_to_generate)
for point in extra_points:
    print(point)
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
(56.434610999999336, 12.838082000000197)
(56.43461799999933, 12.838094000000197
----

So far, so good.
We can now use this approach to compute missing points for the whole run.
We'll first extract the lat/long points and the rawTime value into a list of tuples:

[source, python]
----
import csv
from pyproj import Geod

points = []
with open("points.csv", "r") as event_file:
    reader = csv.reader(event_file, delimiter=",")
    next(reader, None)  # skip the headers
    for row in reader:
        lat = float(row[0])
        lon = float(row[1])
        points.append((lat, lon, int(row[8])))

for point in points[0:5]:
    print(point)
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
(56.434599, 12.838058, 0)
(56.434604, 12.83807, 1)
(56.434625, 12.838106, 4)
(56.434717, 12.838408, 11)
(56.434718, 12.838463, 12)
----

And now let's fill in the missing points:

[source, python]
----
geoid = Geod(ellps="WGS84")

all_points = []
for point1, point2 in zip(points, points[1:]):
    missing_points = (point2[2] - point1[2]) <1>
    if missing_points > 0:
        extra_points = geoid.npts(point1[0], point1[1], point2[0], point2[1], missing_points)
        all_points.append(point1)
        all_points.extend([extra_points[idx] + (point1[2] + idx,) for idx in range(1,len(extra_points))]) <2>
all_points.append(points[-1])

for point in all_points[0:13]:
    print(point)
----
<1> How many points to generate 
<2> Add the new  points along with the number of seconds into the activity

Below are the combined actual points and interpolate points up to the 12th second:
