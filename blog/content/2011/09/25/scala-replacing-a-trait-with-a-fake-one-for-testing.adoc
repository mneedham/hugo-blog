title="Scala: Replacing a trait with a fake one for testing"
tag=['scala']
category=['Scala']
+++

We recently wanted to replace a trait mixed into one of our classes with a fake version to make it easier to test but forgot how exactly to do that!

The class is roughly like this:

[source,scala]
----

trait Foo { def foo : String = "real foo" }
class Mark extends Foo {}
----

We originally tried to replace it like this:

[source,scala]
----

trait BrokenFakeFoo { def foo : String = "broken fake foo" }
val m = new Mark with BrokenFakeFoo
----

[source,text]
----

error: overriding method foo in trait Foo of type => String;
 method foo in trait BrokenFakeFoo of type => String needs `override' modifier
       val m = new Mark with BrokenFakeFoo
----

If +++<cite>+++m+++</cite>+++ compiled it would have two versions of +++<cite>+++foo+++</cite>+++ but it wouldn't know which one to use, hence the error message.

Attempt two was this:

[source,scala]
----

trait BrokenFakeFoo { override def foo : String = "broken fake foo" }
----

[source,text]
----

error: method foo overrides nothing
       trait BrokenFakeFoo { override def foo : String = "broken fake foo" }
----

As https://github.com/uday-rayala[Uday] pointed out, what we actually need to do is make our fake trait extend the original one and then override the method.

[source,scala]
----

trait FakeFoo extends Foo { override def foo : String = "fake foo" }
val m = new Mark with FakeFoo
----

[source,text]
----

m.foo
> res5: String = fake foo
----

Since +++<cite>+++FakeFoo+++</cite>+++ is the right most of the traits mixed into +++<cite>+++Mark+++</cite>+++ its +++<cite>+++foo+++</cite>+++ method will be used over the +++<cite>+++Foo+++</cite>+++ one mixed into +++<cite>+++Mark+++</cite>+++ on its class definition.
