While I've been http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/category/android-2/[learning how to write an android application] there's been plenty of opportunities for me to go off http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/?s=shaving+yak[shaving yaks], it's pretty much Yakville Central.

Typically I'd end up spending hours trying to work out some obscure thing which I didn't really need to know so I wanted to try and avoid that this time.

I started keeping a track of the 'yak stack' which I was currently following and mentally noting exactly where I was up to.

An example of a yak stack I kept while trying to authorise a user of the app with Twitter using OAuth is shown in the photo on the right hand side.

It ended up looking like this:

* Get the home timeline working
 ** OAuth blowing up
  *** Not actually capturing redirect back to app
   **** Launch mode in Android manifest

Once I realise I'm heading down the stack I've been giving myself one http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/[pomodoro] to  try and dig myself one level up.

If I still haven't managed to solve the problem I might keep going for one more pomodoro or just find another way around the problem.

I'm sure I'll come across problems where I need to spend more than an hour trying to solve it but for now it's working ok as a rule of thumb.

It's definitely fun chasing yaks but I get to the end of the day and haven't really achieved anything which isn't fun.
