I've been building a little React app that uses the https://react.semantic-ui.com/[Semantic UI^] library and found myself wanting to render a custom icon.

Semantic UI describes an https://react.semantic-ui.com/elements/icon/[icon^] as "a glyph used to represent something else", and there are a big list of in built icons.
For example, the following code renders a thumbs up icon:

[source,javascript]
----
import {Icon} from "semantic-ui-react";

<Icon name="thumbs up outline icon green large" style={{margin: 0}}/>
----

I wanted to add an icon to indicate that a link would open in a new window, and came across this https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React/issues/931[GitHub issue^] that explains how to add a custom icon.
Instead of using the `name` property, we can use the `className` property to have a icon render based on our own CSS.

Ruard van Elburg explained how to render an open in new window icon in https://stackoverflow.com/a/61104675/1093511[this StackOverflow answer^].

We'll first add the following CSS:

[source,css]
----
i.icon.open-new-window:after {
  content: "\f35d";
}
----

And then can use the `open-new-window` class to render our icon:


[source,javascript]
----
<a href="https://www.neo4j.com" target="_blank">
  <Icon className="open-new-window black"/>
</a>
----

And we're done!
