As part of the preparation for another blog post, I wanted to export a subset of data from one Neo4j database to another one, which seemed like a blog post in its own right.

== Setting up Neo4j

We're going to use the following Docker Compose configuration in this blog post:

.Dockerfile
[source,yaml]
----
version: '3.7'

services:
  neo4j:
    image: neo4j:4.0.0-enterprise
    container_name: "quickgraph-aus-open"
    volumes:
      - ./plugins:/plugins
      - ./data:/data
      - ./import:/var/lib/neo4j/import
    ports:
      - "7474:7474"
      - "7687:7687"
    environment:
      - "NEO4J_ACCEPT_LICENSE_AGREEMENT=yes"
      - "NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/neo"
      - NEO4J_apoc_import_file_use__neo4j__config=true
      - NEO4J_apoc_import_file_enabled=true
      - NEO4J_apoc_export_file_enabled=true
      - NEO4JLABS_PLUGINS=["apoc"]
----

Once we've created that file we need to open a terminal session where that file lives and then run the following command to spin up Neo4j:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

If we run that command, we'll see the following (truncated) output:

[source,text]

Once we see that last line we're ready to roll.

== Exporting data

In the https://markhneedham.com/blog/2020/01/23/quick-graph-australian-open/[Australian Open QuickGraph^] blog post we imported all the matches from the Australian Open tennis tournament.
We can see a sample of the imported graph in the Neo4j Browser visualisation below:

image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2020/01/aus-open-preview.png[title="Sample of the Australian Open Graph"]

Let's quickly check how much data this graph contains.
We'll query the database via the Cypher Shell command, which we can launch by running the following:

[source,bash]
----
$ docker exec -it quickgraph-aus-open cypher-shell -u neo4j -p neo -d womens

Connected to Neo4j 4.0.0 at neo4j://localhost:7687 as user neo4j.
Type :help for a list of available commands or :exit to exit the shell.
Note that Cypher queries must end with a semicolon.
neo4j@womens>
----

We'll use APOC's `apoc.meta.stats` procedure to get back a summary of what's in this database:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.meta.stats()
YIELD nodeCount, relCount, labels, relTypesCount
RETURN nodeCount, relCount, labels, relTypesCount
----

.apoc.meta.stats
[opts="header"]
|===
| nodeCount | relCount | labels | relTypesCount
|  9013      | 27727    | {Player: 571, Set: 5882, Tournament: 20, Match: 2540} | {WINNER: 8383, IN_TOURNAMENT: 2540, NEXT_MATCH: 2520, NEXT_TOURNAMENT: 19, LOSER: 8383, IN_MATCH: 5882}
|===

There's not much data in there, but we only want to export the `Tournament` nodes, `NEXT_TOURNAMENT` relationships, `Match` nodes for the finals, and the `Player` nodes that competed in those finals.
We're going to export the data with a little help from https://neo4j.com/docs/labs/apoc/3.5/[APOC^]'s https://neo4j.com/docs/labs/apoc/current/export/json/[export to JSON procedures^].

When we're using the export procedures, we need to specify some properties that enable this functionality.
In our Dockerfile, we have the following lines:

[source,yaml]
----
  - NEO4J_apoc_import_file_use__neo4j__config=true
  - NEO4J_apoc_export_file_enabled=true
----

These properties are the equivalent of adding the following values to the `apoc.conf` file:

[source,yaml]
----
apoc.import.file.use_neo4j_config=true
apoc.export.file.enabled=true
----

* `apoc.export.file.enabled=true` enables writing export files to disk
* `apoc.import.file.use_neo4j_config=true` writes those export files to the `import` directory


We'll export the data in two parts using the `apoc.export.json.query` procedure, writing:

* one query to export the `Tournament` nodes and the `NEXT_TOURNAMENT` relationships between them
* one query to export the `Match` nodes where `round: "F"` and the associated `Player` and `Tournament` nodes and any relationships

.The following query exports the tournaments to the file `tournaments.json`
[source,cypher]
----
WITH "MATCH path = (t1:Tournament)-[rel:NEXT_TOURNAMENT]->(t2)
      RETURN t1, t2, rel" AS query
CALL apoc.export.json.query(query, "tournaments.json", {format: "plain"})
YIELD file
RETURN file
----

The contents of `tournaments.json`, truncated for brevity, are shown below:

== Importing data

We're now ready to import the data into a new database.
Let's first create a new database and start using it:

[source,cypher]
----
:use system;
CREATE DATABASE blog;
:use blog
----

Before we import any data, let's create the constraints that we had on our original database:

[source, cypher]
----
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (p:Player)
ASSERT p.id IS UNIQUE;

CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (m:Match)
ASSERT m.id IS UNIQUE;

CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (t:Tournament)
ASSERT (t.name, t.year) IS NODE KEY;
----

We can check that those have been created by running the following command:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL db.indexes();
----

.CALL db.indexes()
[opts="header"]
|===
| id | name                  | state    | populationPercent | uniqueness | type    | entityType | labelsOrTypes  | properties       | provider
| 5  | "constraint_989cb13a" | "ONLINE" | 100.0             | "UNIQUE"   | "BTREE" | "NODE"     | ["Tournament"] | ["name", "year"] | "native-btree-1.0"
| 3  | "constraint_a016a763" | "ONLINE" | 100.0             | "UNIQUE"   | "BTREE" | "NODE"     | ["Match"]      | ["id"]           | "native-btree-1.0"
| 1  | "constraint_cbe92269" | "ONLINE" | 100.0             | "UNIQUE"   | "BTREE" | "NODE"     | ["Player"]     | ["id"]           | "native-btree-1.0"
|===

Alright, it's time to import the data!
We're going to use the `apoc.load.json` procedure to do this, and we'll start with `tournaments.json`.

When we're using the import procedures, we need to specify some properties that enable importing from local files.
In our Dockerfile, we have the following lines:

[source,yaml]
----
  - NEO4J_apoc_import_file_use__neo4j__config=true
  - NEO4J_apoc_import_file_enabled=true
----

These properties are the equivalent of adding the following values to the `apoc.conf` file:

[source,yaml]
----
apoc.import.file.use_neo4j_config=true
apoc.import.file.enabled=true
----

* `apoc.import.file.enabled=true` enables reading files to disk
* `apoc.import.file.use_neo4j_config=true` reads those files from the `import` directory

Let's quickly run an exploratory query to remind ourselves the data that we'll be working with:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.json("tournaments.json")
YIELD value
RETURN value.t1, value.t2, value.rel
LIMIT 1;
----

.Exploring `tournaments.json`
[opts="header"]
|===
| value.t1                                                                                             | value.t2                                                                                             | value.rel
| {id: "256", type: "node", properties: {name: "Australian Open", year: 2000}, labels: ["Tournament"]} | {id: "257", type: "node", properties: {name: "Australian Open", year: 2001}, labels: ["Tournament"]} | {start: {id: "256", labels: ["Tournament"]}, end: {id: "257", labels: ["Tournament"]}, id: "10266", label: "NEXT_TOURNAMENT", type: "relationship"}
|===

where:

* `t1` and `t2` represent `Tournament` nodes
* `rel` represents the `NEXT_TOURNAMENT` relationship

We can recreate the original graph structure by running the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.json("tournaments.json") YIELD value
CALL apoc.merge.node(value.t1.labels, value.t1.properties) YIELD node AS t1
CALL apoc.merge.node(value.t2.labels, value.t2.properties) YIELD node AS t2
CALL apoc.merge.relationship(t1, value.rel.label, {}, {}, t2, {}) YIELD rel
RETURN count(*);
----

We're using the `apoc.merge.node` and `apoc.merge.relationship` procedures to create the nodes and relationships.
These procedures are the equivalent of Cypher's https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/merge/[`MERGE`^] clause, and come in handy when we're importing data from a dynamic source
e.g. a JSON file

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| count(*)
| 19
|===

Everything looks good, but let's quickly check the contents of our database by running the `apoc.meta.stats` procedure that we ran earlier:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.meta.stats()
YIELD nodeCount, relCount, labels, relTypesCount
RETURN nodeCount, relCount, labels, relTypesCount;
----

.apoc.meta.stats
[opts="header"]
|===
| nodeCount | relCount | labels | relTypesCount
|  20        | 19       | {Tournament: 20} | {NEXT_TOURNAMENT: 19}
|===

So we've got 20 nodes representing the 20 tournaments from 2000 to 2019 and 19 relationships between them.
So far so good.

Time to import `finalists.json`.
We'll start with an exploratory query:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.json("finalists.json")
YIELD value
RETURN value.t, value.tournRel,
       value.winner, value.winnerRel,
       value.loser, value.loserRel,
       value.match
LIMIT 1;
----

.Exploring `finalists.json`
[opts="header"]
|===
| value.t | value.tournRel   | value.winner                                                                                  | value.winnerRel                                                                                                                | value.loser                                                                                     | value.loserRel                                                                                                                | value.match
| {id: "0", type: "node", properties: {name: "Australian Open", year: 2019}, labels: ["Tournament"]} | {start: {id: "191", labels: ["Match"]}, end: {id: "0", labels: ["Tournament"]}, id: "380", label: "IN_TOURNAMENT", type: "relationship"} | {id: "34", type: "node", properties: {name: "Naomi Osaka", id: "211768"}, labels: ["Player"]} | {start: {id: "34", labels: ["Player"]}, end: {id: "191", labels: ["Match"]}, id: "378", label: "WINNER", type: "relationship"} | {id: "66", type: "node", properties: {name: "Petra Kvitova", id: "201520"}, labels: ["Player"]} | {start: {id: "66", labels: ["Player"]}, end: {id: "191", labels: ["Match"]}, id: "379", label: "LOSER", type: "relationship"} | {id: "191", type: "node", properties: {score: "7-6(2) 5-7 6-4", id: "20190114_226", round: "F"}, labels: ["Match"]}
|===

where:

* `t` represents the `Tournament` node
* `winner` and `loser` represent `Player` nodes
* `match` represents the `Match` node
* `winnerRel` represents the `WINNER` relationship between a `Player` and a `Match`
* `loserRel` represents the `LOSER` relationship between a `Player` and a `Match`
* `tournRel` represents the `IN_TOURNAMENT` relationship between a `Match` and a `Tournament`

Let's now run the following query to import our matches:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.load.json("finalists.json") yield value
CALL apoc.merge.node(value.winner.labels, value.winner.properties) YIELD node AS winner
CALL apoc.merge.node(value.loser.labels, value.loser.properties) YIELD node AS loser
CALL apoc.merge.node(value.match.labels, value.match.properties) YIELD node AS match

CALL apoc.merge.relationship(winner, value.winnerRel.label, {}, {}, match, {}) YIELD rel AS winnerRel
CALL apoc.merge.relationship(loser, value.loserRel.label, {}, {}, match, {}) YIELD rel AS loserRel

return count(*);
----

Let's do one last call to `apoc.meta.stats`:

And finally, let's run one of the queries from the original QuickGraph post to check that everything's in order:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (winner:Player)-[:WINNER]->(match:Match {round: "F"})<-[:LOSER]-(loser),
      (match)-[:IN_TOURNAMENT]->(tournament)
RETURN tournament.year AS year, winner.name AS winner,
       loser.name AS loser, match.score AS score
ORDER BY tournament.year
