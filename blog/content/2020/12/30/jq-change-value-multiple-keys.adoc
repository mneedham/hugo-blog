https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq^], the command-line JSON processor, is my favourite tool for transforming JSON documents.
In this post we're going to learn how to use it to transform the values for specific keys in a document, while leaving everything else untouched.

We have the following file, which contains one JSON document:

./tmp/foo.json
[source,json]

{"id":1341735877953904600,"conversation_id":"1341735877953904641","created_at":"2020-12-23 13:22:16 GMT","date":"2020-12-23","time":"13:22:16","timezone":"+0000","user_id":"972709154329591800","username":"dondaconceicao","name":"T N Biscuits","place":"","tweet":"Can’t imagine being sick with covid while living alone","language":"en","mentions":[],"urls":[],"photos":[],"replies_count":0,"retweets_count":0,"likes_count":1,"hashtags":[],"cashtags":[],"link":"https://twitter.com/dondaconceicao/status/1341735877953904641","retweet":false,"quote_url":"","video":0,"thumbnail":"","near":"London","geo":"","source":"","user_rt_id":"","user_rt":"","retweet_id":"","reply_to":[],"retweet_date":"","translate":"","trans_src":"","trans_dest":""}

We want to update the `id` field so that its value is a string rather than numeric value.
We can do this using the https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#tostring[`tostring`^] function, as shown below:

[source,bash]
----
cat /tmp/foo.json |  jq -c '.id=(.id|tostring)'
----

.Output
[source,json]
----
{"id":"1341735877953904600","conversation_id":"1341735877953904641","created_at":"2020-12-23 13:22:16 GMT","date":"2020-12-23","time":"13:22:16","timezone":"+0000","user_id":"972709154329591800","username":"dondaconceicao","name":"T N Biscuits","place":"","tweet":"Can’t imagine being sick with covid while living alone","language":"en","mentions":[],"urls":[],"photos":[],"replies_count":0,"retweets_count":0,"likes_count":1,"hashtags":[],"cashtags":[],"link":"https://twitter.com/dondaconceicao/status/1341735877953904641","retweet":false,"quote_url":"","video":0,"thumbnail":"","near":"London","geo":"","source":"","user_rt_id":"","user_rt":"","retweet_id":"","reply_to":[],"retweet_date":"","translate":"","trans_src":"","trans_dest":""}
----

All the other fields are left as they were before.
So far so good.

But what if we want to change the `user_id` key as well?
My first attempt was to comma separate the two filters:

[source,bash]
----
cat /tmp/foo.json |  jq -c '.id=(.id|tostring),.user_id=(.user_id|tostring)'
----


.Output
[source,json]

Hmmm, now we have two rows instead of one, which isn't what we want!
Each filter has been applied individually rather than one after the other.

We can fix this by piping one filter into the other using the `|` operator.
Let's give that a try:

[source,bash]
----
cat /tmp/foo.json |  jq -c '.id=(.id|tostring) | .user_id=(.user_id|tostring)'
----

.Output
[source,json]
----
{"id":"1341735877953904600","conversation_id":"1341735877953904641","created_at":"2020-12-23 13:22:16 GMT","date":"2020-12-23","time":"13:22:16","timezone":"+0000","user_id":"972709154329591800","username":"dondaconceicao","name":"T N Biscuits","place":"","tweet":"Can’t imagine being sick with covid while living alone","language":"en","mentions":[],"urls":[],"photos":[],"replies_count":0,"retweets_count":0,"likes_count":1,"hashtags":[],"cashtags":[],"link":"https://twitter.com/dondaconceicao/status/1341735877953904641","retweet":false,"quote_url":"","video":0,"thumbnail":"","near":"London","geo":"","source":"","user_rt_id":"","user_rt":"","retweet_id":"","reply_to":[],"retweet_date":"","translate":"","trans_src":"","trans_dest":""}

Much better!
