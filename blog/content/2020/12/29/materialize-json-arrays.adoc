In https://markhneedham.com/blog/2020/12/17/materialize-querying-json-file/[a blog post I wrote a couple of weeks ago^], we learned how to analyse JSON files using the https://materialize.com/[Materialize^] SQL streaming database.

In this post we're going to build on that knowledge to analyse a JSON file of tweets that contain arrays of hashtags.
It took me a while to figure out to do this, so I wanted to share what I learnt along the way.

The JSON file that we're going to analyse looks like this and we'll save that file in a `data` directory locally.

----

== Connecting to Materialize

We're going to query that data using Materialize, which we'll set up using the following Docker Compose configuration:

.docker-compose.yml
[source,yaml]
----
  version: '3'
  services:
    materialize:
      image: materialize/materialized:v0.5.3
      container_name: "materialize-sandbox-docker-compose"
      volumes:
        - ./data:/data
      ports:
        - "6875:6875"
----

The `data` directory containing the https://github.com/mneedham/materialize-sandbox/blob/main/twitter/data/covid_sample.json[`covid_sample.json`^] file is in the https://github.com/mneedham/materialize-sandbox/tree/main/twitter[mneedham/materialize-sandbox/twitter^] GitHub repository.
The repository also contains setup instructions.

Once we've cloned that repository, we can launch Materialize by running the following command:

[source, bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

We're now ready to connect to Materialize, which we can do using the https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/app-psql.html[`psql` CLI tool^]:

[source, bash]
----
psql -h localhost -p 6875 materialize
----

.Results
[source,text]
----
psql (12.5 (Ubuntu 12.5-0ubuntu0.20.04.1), server 9.5.0)
Type "help" for help.

materialize=>
----

== Creating a materialized view

Now we're to create a source around the file and then a materialized view on top of that source.

.CREATE SOURCE
[source,sql]
----
CREATE SOURCE covid_sample_source
FROM FILE '/data/covid_sample.json'
WITH(tail=true)
FORMAT TEXT;
----

.CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW
[source,sql]
----
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW covid_sample AS
SELECT  (val->>'id')::float::bigint AS id,
        (val->>'username')::text AS username,
        (val->>'hashtags')::text AS hashtags,
        (val->>'tweet')::text AS tweet
FROM (SELECT text::jsonb AS val FROM covid_sample_source);
----

We can describe the view by running the following query:

[source,sql]
----
SHOW COLUMNS
FROM covid_sample;
----


.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
|name   | nullable | type
|hashtags | t        | text
|id       | t        | int8
|tweet | t        | text
|username | t        | text

|===

The interesting thing here is that the `hashtags` column is storing data in the `text` type.

== Querying a materialized view

Now it's time to write some queries.
Let's start with a query that returns all columns and rows in the `covid_sample` view:

[source,sql]
----
SElECT *
FROM covid_sample;
----


.Results
[opts="header", cols="1,1,1,2"]
|===
|id          |    username     |                                                    hashtags                                                    |                                                                                                                         tweet

I wanted to write a query that shows how many tweets each hashtag appears in, so we'll need to 'explode' the values in `hashtags` column into rows, which we can do using the https://materialize.com/docs/sql/types/jsonb/#jsonb_array_elements[`jsonb_array_elements`] function.

My first attempt was the following:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT jsonb_array_elements(hashtags) AS ht
FROM covid_sample
LIMIT 5;
----

.Results
|===
| ERROR:  table function (jsonb_array_elements) in scalar position not yet supported, see https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize/issues/1546 for more details
|===

This error indicates that we need to use the `json_array_elements` function in the `FROM` part of the query.
Let's try that:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT ht
FROM covid_sample,
     jsonb_array_elements(hashtags) AS ht
LIMIT 5;
----

.Results
|===
| ERROR:  Cannot call function jsonb_array_elements(string): arguments cannot be implicitly cast to any implementation's parameters; try providing explicit casts
|===

Hmmm, still no good.
The problem this time is that the `jsonb_array_elements` function excepts to receive values of type `jsonb` and the `hashtags` column returns values of type `text`.
We can fix that by casting to the correct type, like this:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT ht
FROM covid_sample,
     jsonb_array_elements(hashtags :: jsonb) AS ht
LIMIT 5;
----

.Results
[opts="header"  ]
|===
|ht
|"iot"
|"data"
|"xmas"
|"covid"
|"tier4"
|===

Success!
Now we can write a query that shows how many times each hashtag has been used:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT ht, count(*) AS count
FROM covid_sample,
     jsonb_array_elements(hashtags :: jsonb) AS ht
GROUP BY ht
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 5;
----

.Results
[opts="header"  ]
|===
|ht       | count
| "coronavirus" |     2
|"iot"         |     1
|"data"        |     1
|"xmas"        |     1
|"covid"       |     1
|===

We could even go further than this and create a view that returns hashtags and their counts:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW covid_hashtags AS
SELECT ht, count(*) AS count
FROM covid_sample,
     jsonb_array_elements(hashtags :: jsonb) AS ht
GROUP BY ht
ORDER BY count DESC;
----

Which we can query like this:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT *
FROM covid_hashtags
LIMIT 5;
----

.Results
[opts="header"  ]
|===
|ht    | count
|"iot"   |     1
|"data"  |     1
|"xmas"  |     1
|"covid" |     1
|"tier4" |     1
|===

Interestingly the `ORDER BY` doesn't seem to be reflected in the results.
I learnt from https://twitter.com/frankmcsherry[Frank McSherry^] that it's actually a feature of SQL that the `ORDER BY` clause isn't inherited from the view.

Now let's add a couple of extra tweets to the end of `covid_sample.json`:

[source,json]
----
{"id": "1341759529520926722", "conversation_id": "1341759529520926722", "created_at": "2020-12-23 14:56:15 GMT", "date": "2020-12-23", "time": "14:56:15", "timezone": "+0000", "user_id": 368587842, "username": "piterk68", "name": "Peter Lewis", "place": "", "tweet": "A quick thread reflecting on two themes of my year : #COVID &amp; #Inequality particularly race inequality, with a few thank yous at the end:", "language": "en", "mentions": [], "urls": [], "photos": [], "replies_count": 1, "retweets_count": 0, "likes_count": 1, "hashtags": ["covid", "inequality"], "cashtags": [], "link": "https://twitter.com/piterk68/status/1341759529520926722", "retweet": false, "quote_url": "", "video": 0, "thumbnail": "", "near": "London", "geo": "", "source": "", "user_rt_id": "", "user_rt": "", "retweet_id": "", "reply_to": [], "retweet_date": "", "translate": "", "trans_src": "", "trans_dest": ""}

----

And if we run the query against `covid_hashtags` again:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT *
FROM covid_hashtags
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 5;
----

The hashtags from those tweets will be reflected in the results returned:


.Results
[opts="header"  ]
|===
| ht       | count
| "coronavirus" |     3
|"covid"       |     2
|"covid19"     |     2
|"iot"         |     1
|"data"        |     1
