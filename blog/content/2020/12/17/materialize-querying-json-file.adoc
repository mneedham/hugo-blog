I recently learnt about https://materialize.com/[Materialize^], a SQL streaming database, via their https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/30/materialize-scores-40-million-investment-for-sql-streaming-database/[Series B fundraising announcement^], and thought I'd take it for a spin.

My go-to dataset for new databases is Strava, an app that I use to record my runs.
It has an API that returns a JSON representation of each run, containing information like the distance covered, elapsed time, heart rate metrics, and more.

I've extracted my latest 30 activities to a file in the JSON lines format and in this post we're going to analyse that data using Materialize.

image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2020/12/materialize-banner.png[]

The data is stored in the https://github.com/mneedham/materialize-sandbox/blob/main/strava/data/activities-clean.json[`activities-clean.json`^] file on the https://github.com/mneedham/materialize-sandbox/tree/main/strava[mneedham/materialize-sandbox^] repository.
Below is an example of the first line in this file:

[source,json]
----
{"resource_state":2,"athlete":{"id":6958432,"resource_state":1},"name":"Morning Run","distance":14175.1,"moving_time":4222,"elapsed_time":4391,"total_elevation_gain":105.4,"type":"Run","workout_type":null,"id":4470124807,"upload_id":4776694342,"start_date":"2020-12-14T05:31:43Z","start_date_local":"2020-12-14T05:31:43Z","timezone":"(GMT+00:00) Europe/London","utc_offset":0,"location_city":null,"location_state":null,"location_country":"United Kingdom","achievement_count":0,"kudos_count":2,"comment_count":0,"athlete_count":1,"photo_count":0,"trainer":false,"commute":false,"manual":false,"private":false,"visibility":"everyone","flagged":false,"gear_id":"g7064038","from_accepted_tag":false,"upload_id_str":"4776694342","average_speed":3.357,"max_speed":4.3,"average_cadence":87.4,"has_heartrate":true,"average_heartrate":150.3,"max_heartrate":168,"heartrate_opt_out":false,"display_hide_heartrate_option":true,"elev_high":76.2,"elev_low":25,"pr_count":0,"total_photo_count":0,"has_kudoed":false,"suffer_score":116}

== Connecting to Materialize

We're going to query that data using Materialize, which we'll set up using the following Docker Compose configuration:

.docker-compose.yml
[source,yaml]
----
  version: '3'
  services:
    materialize:
      image: materialize/materialized:v0.5.3
      container_name: "materialize-sandbox-docker-compose"
      volumes:
        - ./data:/data
      ports:
        - "6875:6875"
----

The `data` directory containing the `activities-clean.json` file is in the https://github.com/mneedham/materialize-sandbox/tree/main/strava[mneedham/materialize-sandbox/strava^] GitHub repository.
The repository also contains setup instructions.

Once we've cloned that repository, we can launch Materialize by running the following command:

[source, bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

We should see the following output:

.Results
[source,text]

== Creating a materialized view

To query this file using Materialize we'll need to create a source around the file and then a materialized view on top of that source.
My understanding of the architecture at a high level is shown in the diagram below:

image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2020/12/materialize-architecture.png[title="Materialize Architecture"]

Let's now create a source on top of the file.
We can do this using the https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/[`CREATE SOURCE`^] clause, as shown below:

[source, sql]
----
CREATE SOURCE activities
FROM FILE '/data/activities-clean.json' FORMAT TEXT;
----

We need to indicate where the file lives on the server, as well as the format of its contents.
We also need to specify the format of the file, which in this case is https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/text-file/[`TEXT`^].
We'll be able to describe the JSON structure in more detail when we create the view.

We can describe the source by running the following query:

[source, sql]
----
SHOW COLUMNS FROM activities;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
|  name    | nullable | type
| mz_line_no | f        | int8
|  text       | f        | text

|===

So the main field we're interested in is the `text` one, which contains our JSON documents.

Next we're going to create a materialized view, in which we can use https://materialize.com/docs/sql/functions/#json[JSON functions^] to extract fields from the JSON documents and cast them to appropriate types.
By default fields are imported as the `text` type.
We can pull out the interesting data from the activities by creating the following materialized view:

[source, sql]
----
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW activities_view AS

SELECT  (val->>'id')::float::bigint AS id,
        (val->>'distance')::float AS distance,
        (val->>'moving_time')::float::int AS moving_time,
        (val->>'elapsed_time')::float::int AS elapsed_time,
        (val->>'total_elevation_gain')::float AS total_elevation_gain,
        (val->>'elev_high')::float AS elev_high,
        (val->>'elev_low')::float AS elev_low,
        (val->>'average_speed')::float AS average_speed,
        (val->>'max_speed')::float AS max_speed,
        (val->>'average_heartrate')::float AS average_heartrate,
        (val->>'max_heartrate')::float AS max_heartrate,
        (val->>'start_date')::timestamp AS start_date

FROM (SELECT text::json AS val FROM activities);
----

While I was working out which fields to extract, I found myself repeatedly creating and dropping the view.
We can drop the view using the `DROP VIEW` clause:

[source, sql]
----
DROP VIEW activities_view;
----

And once we're happy with it, we can use the `SHOW COLUMNS` clause to describe the view, as shown below:

[source, sql]
----
SHOW COLUMNS FROM activities_view;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
|name         | nullable |   type
|average_heartrate    | t        | float8
|average_speed        | t        | float8
|distance             | t        | float8
|elapsed_time         | t        | int4
|elev_high            | t        | float8
|elev_low             | t        | float8
|id                   | t        | int8
|max_heartrate        | t        | float8
|max_speed            | t        | float8
|moving_time          | t        | int4
|start_date           | t        | timestamp
|total_elevation_gain | t        | float8

|===

== Querying a materialized view

Ok, now it's time for some fun, let's query the materialized view that we've just created.

We'll start with a SQL query that returns the latest 10 activities, sorted in descending order by `start_date`:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT *
FROM activities_view
ORDER BY start_date DESC
LIMIT 10;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| id     | distance | moving_time | elapsed_time | total_elevation_gain | elev_high | elev_low | average_speed | max_speed | average_heartrate | max_heartrate |     start_date
 |470124807 |  14175.1 |        4222 |         4391 |                105.4 |      76.2 |       25 |         3.357 |       4.3 |             150.3 |           168 | 2020-12-14 05:31:43

|===

We can use all the SQL aggregation functions that we're used to.
So if we wanted to work out the distance run, grouped by month, we could write the following query that uses the https://materialize.com/docs/sql/functions/date-trunc/[`date_trunc`^] function:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT date_trunc('month', start_date) AS month,
       sum(distance) AS totalDistance
FROM activities_view
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
----


.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
|month        |   totaldistance
|2020-10-01 00:00:00 |  75149.69999992847
|2020-11-01 00:00:00 | 194009.49999952316
|2020-12-01 00:00:00 | 101772.19999974966
|===

I ran a lot more in November than the other two months, but admittedly we don't have complete data for October or December (so far).
If we pull in all that data, the total distance covered would likely be similar.

What about the fastest run and the pace per mile on that run?
We can compute with a little help from the https://materialize.com/docs/sql/functions/to_char/[`to_char`^] function:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT start_date, distance,
       to_char(to_timestamp(moving_time / distance * 1609.34), 'MI:SS') AS pacePerMile,
       to_char(to_timestamp(moving_time), 'HH24:MI:SS') AS time
FROM activities_view
ORDER BY moving_time / distance
LIMIT 10;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| start_date      | distance | pacepermile |   time
|2020-12-12 06:28:06 |  13132.6 | 07:44       | 01:03:14
|2020-12-09 05:17:29 |  12304.8 | 07:46       | 00:59:27
|2020-10-21 04:34:38 |  12624.5 | 07:48       | 01:01:14
|2020-10-23 03:49:00 |  13762.7 | 07:49       | 01:06:57
|2020-12-11 04:15:32 |  12244.8 | 07:50       | 00:59:40
|2020-12-14 05:31:43 |  14175.1 | 07:59       | 01:10:22
|2020-10-24 06:04:41 |  13703.4 | 08:01       | 01:08:21
|2020-10-30 05:43:05 |   8172.7 | 08:02       | 00:40:49
|2020-10-28 05:33:27 |  14494.7 | 08:05       | 01:12:52
|2020-11-18 05:42:50 |  11968.1 | 08:06       | 01:00:16
|===

It looks like my fastest run was just a few days ago, but I have had a few others that were at a similar pace.

We could combine the previous two queries together to find the fastest pace per month, as shown in the following query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT to_char(date_trunc('month', start_date), 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
       to_char(to_timestamp(min(moving_time / distance * 1609.34)), 'MI:SS') AS pacePerMile,
       to_char(to_timestamp(min(moving_time)), 'HH24:MI:SS') AS time
FROM activities_view
GROUP BY month;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
| month  | pacepermile |   time
|2020-10 | 07:48       | 00:40:49
|2020-11 | 08:06       | 00:39:39
|2020-12 | 07:44       | 00:59:27
|===

If we wanted to also show the average pace per mile, we could do this using the `avg` function instead of the `min` function on the 2nd line of the query:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT to_char(date_trunc('month', start_date), 'YYYY-MM') AS month,
       to_char(to_timestamp(min(moving_time / distance * 1609.34)), 'MI:SS') AS bestPacePerMile,
       to_char(to_timestamp(avg(moving_time / distance * 1609.34)), 'MI:SS') AS averagePacePerMile
FROM activities_view
GROUP BY month;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]
|===
|month  | bestpacepermile | averagepacepermile
|2020-10 | 07:48           | 08:00
|2020-11 | 08:06           | 08:23
|2020-12 | 07:44           | 08:04
|===

== In summary

I've only skimmed the surface of what we can do with Materialize.
From my understanding, a more common use case is to execute SQL queries over streaming data, whereas what we have here is a flat file with static content.
I guess querying streaming data is the next thing for me to explore!
