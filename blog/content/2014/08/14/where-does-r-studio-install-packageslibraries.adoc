title="Where does r studio install packages/libraries?"
tag=['r-2']

As a newbie to R I wanted to look at the source code of some of the libraries/packages that I'd installed via R Studio which I initially struggled to do as I wasn't sure where the packages had been installed.

I eventually came across http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15170399/changing-r-default-library-path-using-libpaths-in-rprofile-site-fails-to-work[a StackOverflow post] which described the +++<cite>+++http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/libPaths.html[.libPaths]+++</cite>+++ function which tells us where that is:

[source,r]
----

> .libPaths()
[1] "/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/library"
----

If we want to see which libraries are installed we can use the +++<cite>+++http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/list.files.html[list.files]+++</cite>+++ function:

[source,r]

We can then drill into those directories to find the appropriate file - in this case I wanted to look at one of the http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rook/Rook.pdf[Rook] examples:

[source,text]
----

$ cat /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.1/Resources/library/Rook/exampleApps/helloworld.R
app <- function(env){
    req <- Rook::Request$new(env)
    res <- Rook::Response$new()
    friend <- 'World'
    if (!is.null(req$GET()[['friend']]))
	friend <- req$GET()[['friend']]
    res$write(paste('<h1>Hello',friend,'</h1>\n'))
    res$write('What is your name?\n')
    res$write('<form method="GET">\n')
    res$write('<input type="text" name="friend">\n')
    res$write('<input type="submit" name="Submit">\n</form>\n<br>')
    res$finish()
}
