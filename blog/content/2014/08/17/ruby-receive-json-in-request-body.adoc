title="Ruby: Receive JSON in request body"
tag=['ruby']

I've been building a little http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html[Sinatra] app to play around with the Google Drive API and one thing I struggled with was processing JSON posted in the request body.

I came across a few posts which suggested that the request body would be available as +++<cite>+++params['data']+++</cite>+++ or +++<cite>+++request['data']+++</cite>+++ but after trying several ways of sending a POST request that doesn't seem to be the case.

I eventually came across http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17049569/how-to-parse-json-request-body-in-sinatra-just-once-and-expose-it-to-all-routes[this StackOverflow post] which shows how to do it:

[source,ruby]
----

require 'sinatra'
require 'json'

post '/somewhere/' do
  request.body.rewind
  request_payload = JSON.parse request.body.read

  p request_payload

  "win"
end
----

I can then POST to that endpoint and see the JSON printed back on the console:

+++<cite>+++dummy.json+++</cite>+++

[source,json]
----

{"i": "am json"}
----

[source,bash]
----

$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -XPOST http://localhost:9393/somewhere/ -d @dummy.json
----

[source,text]
----

{"i"=>"am json"}
----

Of course if I'd just http://www.sinatrarb.com/intro.html[RTFM] I could have found this out much more quickly!
