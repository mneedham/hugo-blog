title="Neo4j: Set Based Operations with the experimental Cypher optimiser"

A few months ago I wrote about http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2014/02/20/neo4j-cypher-set-based-operations/[cypher queries which look for a missing relationship] and showed how you could optimise them by re-working the query slightly.

To refresh, we wanted to find all the people in the London office that I hadn't worked with given this model\...

\...and this initial query:

[source,cypher]
----

MATCH (p:Person {name: "me"})-[:MEMBER_OF]->(office {name: "London Office"})<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(colleague)
WHERE NOT (p-[:COLLEAGUES]->(colleague))
RETURN COUNT(colleague)
----

This took on average 7.46 seconds to execute using https://github.com/mneedham/cypher-query-tuning[cypher-query-tuning] so we came up with the following version which took 150 ms on average:

[source,cypher]
----

MATCH (p:Person {name: "me"})-[:COLLEAGUES]->(colleague)
WITH p, COLLECT(colleague) as marksColleagues
MATCH (colleague)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(office {name: "London Office"})<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(p)
WHERE NOT (colleague IN marksColleagues)
RETURN COUNT(colleague)
----

With the http://neo4j.com/blog/neo4j-2-1-graph-etl/[release of Neo4j 2.1] we can now make use of Ronja - the experimental Cypher optimiser - which performs much better for certain types of queries. I thought I'd give it a try against this one.

We can use the experimental optimiser by prefixing our query like so:

[source,cypher]
----

cypher 2.1.experimental MATCH (p:Person {name: "me"})-[:MEMBER_OF]->(office {name: "London Office"})<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(colleague)
WHERE NOT (p-[:COLLEAGUES]->(colleague))
RETURN COUNT(colleague)
----

If we run that through the query tuner we get the following results:

[source,bash]
----

$ python set-based.py

cypher 2.1.experimental MATCH (p:Person {name: "me"})-[:MEMBER_OF]->(office {name: "London Office"})<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(colleague)
WHERE NOT (p-[:COLLEAGUES]->(colleague))
RETURN COUNT(colleague)
Min 0.719580888748 50% 0.723278999329 95% 0.741609430313 Max 0.743646144867


MATCH (p:Person {name: "me"})-[:COLLEAGUES]->(colleague)
WITH p, COLLECT(colleague) as marksColleagues
MATCH (colleague)-[:MEMBER_OF]->(office {name: "London Office"})<-[:MEMBER_OF]-(p)
WHERE NOT (colleague IN marksColleagues)
RETURN COUNT(colleague)
Min 0.706955909729 50% 0.715770959854 95% 0.731880950928 Max 0.733670949936

As you can see there's not much in it - our original query now runs as quickly as the optimised one. Ronja #ftw!

Give it a try on your slow queries and see how it gets on. There'll certainly be some cases where it's slower but over time it should be faster for a reasonable chunk of queries.
