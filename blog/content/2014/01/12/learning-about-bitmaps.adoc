A few weeks ago https://twitter.com/apcj[Alistair] and I were working on the code used to model the http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/graphdb-neo4j-labels.html[labels] that a node has attached to it in a Neo4j database.

The way this works is that chunks of 32 nodes ids are represented as a 32 bit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap[bitmap] for each label where a 1 for a bit means that a node has the label and a 0 means that it doesn't.

For example, let's say we have node ids 0-31 where 0 is the highest bit and 31 is the lowest bit. If only node 0 has the label then that'd be represented as the following value:

[source,java]
----

java> int bitmap = 1 << 31;
int bitmap = -2147483648
----

If we imagine the 32 bits positioned next to each other it would http://www.binaryconvert.com/convert_signed_int.html[look like this]:

[source,java]
----

java> 0X80000000;
Integer res16 = -2147483648
----

The next thing we want to do is work out whether a node has a label applied or not. We can do this by using a bitwise AND.

For example to check whether the highest bit is set we would write the following code:

[source,java]
----

java> bitmap & (1 << 31);
Integer res10 = -2147483648
----

That is set as we would imagine. Now let's check a a few bits that we know aren't set:

[source,java]
----

java> bitmap & (1 << 0);
Integer res11 = 0

java> bitmap & (1 << 1);
Integer res12 = 0

java> bitmap & (1 << 30);
Integer res13 = 0
----

Another operation we might want to do is set another bit on our existing bitmap for which we can use a bitwise inclusive OR.

A bitwise inclusive OR means that a bit will be set if either value has the bit set or if both have it set.

Let's set the second highest bit. and visualise that calculation:

image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2014/01/2014-01-12_15-45-161.png[2014 01 12 15 45 16,600]

If we evaluate that we'd expect the two highest bits to be set:

[source,java]
----

java> bitmap |= (1 << 30);
Integer res14 = -1073741824
----

Now if we visualise the bitmap we'll see that is indeed the case:

image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2014/01/2014-01-12_17-16-21.png[2014 01 12 17 16 21,600]

[source,java]
----

java> 0XC0000000;
Integer res15 = -1073741824
----

The next operation we want to do is to unset a bit that we're already set for which we can use a bitwise exclusive OR.

An exclusive OR means that a bit will only remain set if there's a combination of (0 and 1) or (1 and 0) in the calculation. If there are two 1's or 2 0's then it'll be unset.

Let's unset the 2nd highest bit so that we're left with just the top bit being set.

If we visualise that we have the following calculation:

image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2014/01/2014-01-12_17-33-21.png[2014 01 12 17 33 21,600]

And if we evaluate that we're back to our original bitmap:

[source,java]
----

java> bitmap ^= (1 << 30);
Integer res2 = -2147483648
----

I used the http://www.javarepl.com/console.html[Java REPL] to evaluate the code samples in this post and http://www.roseindia.net/java/master-java/bitwise-bitshift-operators.shtml[this article explains bitshift operators very clearly].

The Neo4j version of the bitmap described in this post is in the https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/blob/master/community/lucene-index/src/main/java/org/neo4j/kernel/api/impl/index/bitmaps/BitmapFormat.java[BitmapFormat] class on github.
