title="Python: Converting a date string to timestamp"

I've been playing around with Python over the last few days while cleaning up a data set and one thing I wanted to do was translate date strings into a timestamp.

I started with a date in this format:

[source,python]
----

date_text = "13SEP2014"
----

So the first step is to translate that into a Python date - the https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior[strftime section of the documentation] is useful for figuring out which format code is needed:

[source,python]
----

import datetime

date_text = "13SEP2014"
date = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_text, "%d%b%Y")

print(date)
----

[source,bash]
----

$ python dates.py
2014-09-13 00:00:00
----

The next step was to translate that to a UNIX timestamp. I thought there might be a method or property on the Date object that I could access but I couldn't find one and so ended up using https://docs.python.org/2/library/calendar.html#calendar.timegm[calendar] to do the transformation:

[source,python]
----

import datetime
import calendar

date_text = "13SEP2014"
date = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_text, "%d%b%Y")

print(date)
print(calendar.timegm(date.utctimetuple()))
----

[source,text]
----

$ python dates.py
2014-09-13 00:00:00
1410566400
----

It's not too tricky so hopefully I shall remember next time.
