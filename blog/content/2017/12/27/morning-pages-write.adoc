I've been http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/[journalling] for almost 2 years now but some days I get stuck and can't think of anything to write about.

I did a bit of searching to see if anybody had advice on solving this problem and found a few different articles:

* https://blog.doist.com/benefits-of-journaling-81b663a27608[The Productive Benefits of Journaling (plus 11 ideas for making the habit stick)]
* https://medium.com/darius-foroux/read-this-if-you-want-to-keep-a-journal-but-dont-know-how-a3f081d360aa[Read This If You Want To Keep A Journal But Don't Know How]
* http://tinybuddha.com/blog/turn-pain-to-joy-11-tips-for-a-powerful-gratitude-journal/[Turn Pain to Joy: 11 Tips for a Powerful Gratitude Journal]
* https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal[Tips for Keeping a Gratitude Journal]
* https://www.buzzfeed.com/rachelwmiller/how-to-start-a-bullet-journal?utm_term=.vwdGL53Dp#.swwEzg5kD[WTF Is A Bullet Journal And Why Should You Start One? An Explainer]

The articles talk about different approaches to journalling and since I'm not following one particular approach I thought I'd summarise all their ideas and put them in a document that I can use. I've also added some of my own ones.

Here's the list:

* Something you're grateful for
* An unusual event
* Goals or hopes
* A past event
* Things that are stopping you achieving your goals
* Values that are important to you
* Ideas or nagging thoughts
* What did you do yesterday?
 ** What did you work on?
 ** Who did you talk to?
 ** What book did you read?
 ** What podcasts did you listen to?
 ** What TV shows/movies did you watch?
 ** Where did you go?
* What are you doing today?
* What scares you?
* Decisions you need to make/made - small or big

If you have any other ideas of what I can write about let me know in the comments. While researching for this post I noticed that Julia Cameron, the inventor of Morning Pages, has a new book out - https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B073QXSCWC/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o00_?ie=UTF8&psc=1[The Right to Write: An Invitation and Initiation into the Writing Life] - so I'm hoping to get some ideas from there as well.
