Sometimes the simplest things can provide the greatest value to project teams. We often look for a technical solution to problems where something simpler would achieve the same aim.

The Information Wall is as its name may suggest a place where you can put information that people in the team need to know but which they have not (yet) committed to memory.

Examples of things that you could put on an information wall could be:

* Wiki url
* SVN repository url
* Remote machine names & credentials
* Build server url
* Useful phone numbers
* Anything else that's needed!

Although it may seem to add very little value I think it's a really good tool for making information accessible to people. It also means you avoid the valueless conversations where team members keep interrupting each other to ask for these details.

Having the wall as close to the development team area as possible is ideal.
