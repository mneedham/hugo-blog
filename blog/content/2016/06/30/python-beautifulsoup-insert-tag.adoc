title="Python: BeautifulSoup - Insert tag"
tag=['python']

I've been scraping the Game of Thrones wiki in preparation http://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-London/events/231014802/[for a meetup at Women Who Code next week] and while attempting to extract character allegiances I wanted to insert missing line breaks to separate different allegiances.

I initially tried http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14652706/python-beautifulsoup-add-tags-around-found-keyword[creating a line break] like this:

[source,python]
----

>>> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
>>> tag = BeautifulSoup("<br />", "html.parser")
>>> tag
<br/>
----

It looks like it should work but later on in my script I check the 'name' attribute to work out whether I've got a line break and it doesn't return the value I expected it to:

[source,python]
----

>>> tag.name
u'[document]'
----

My script assumes it's going to return the string 'br' so I needed another way of creating the tag. The following does the trick:

[source,python]
----

>>> from bs4 import Tag
>>> tag = Tag(name = "br")
>>> tag
<br></br>
----

[source,python]
----

>>> tag.name
'br'
----

That's all for now, back to scraping for me!
