title="R: substr - Getting a vector of positions"

I recently found myself writing an R script to extract parts of a string based on a beginning and end index which is reasonably easy using the +++<cite>+++https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/substr.html[substr]+++</cite>+++ function:

[source,r]
----

> substr("mark loves graphs", 0, 4)
[1] "mark"
----

But what if we have a vector of start and end positions?

[source,r]
----

> substr("mark loves graphs", c(0, 6), c(4, 10))
[1] "mark"
----

Hmmm that didn't work as I expected! It turns out we actually need to use the +++<cite>+++https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/substr.html[substring]+++</cite>+++ function instead which wasn't initially obvious to me on reading the documentation:

[source,r]
----

> substring("mark loves graphs", c(0, 6, 12), c(4, 10, 17))
[1] "mark"   "loves"  "graphs"
----

Easy when you know how!
