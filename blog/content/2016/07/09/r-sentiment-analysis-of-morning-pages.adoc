+++

A couple of months ago I came across a cool blog post by https://twitter.com/juliasilge[Julia Silge] where she http://juliasilge.com/blog/Joy-to-the-World/[runs a sentiment analysis algorithm over her tweet stream] to see how her tweet sentiment has varied over time.

I wanted to give it a try but couldn't figure out how to get a dump of my tweets so I decided to try it out on the text from my http://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/[morning pages] writing which I've been experimenting with for a few months.

Here's an explanation of morning pages if you haven't come across it before:

____
Morning Pages are three pages of longhand, stream of consciousness writing, done first thing in the morning. *There is no wrong way to do Morning Pages* -- they are not high art. They are not even "`writing.`" They are about anything and everything that crosses your mind-- and they are for your eyes only. Morning Pages provoke, clarify, comfort, cajole, prioritize and synchronize the day at hand. Do not over-think Morning Pages: just put three pages of anything on the page...and then do three more pages tomorrow.
____

Most of my writing is complete gibberish but I thought it'd be fun to see how my mood changes over time and see if it identifies any peaks or troughs in sentiment that I could then look into further.

I've got one file per day so we'll start by building a data frame containing the text, one row per day:

[source,r]
----

library(syuzhet)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(reshape2)
library(dplyr)

root="/path/to/files"
files = list.files(root)

df = data.frame(file = files, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
df$fullPath = paste(root, df$file, sep = "/")
df$text = sapply(df$fullPath, get_text_as_string)
----

We end up with a data frame with 3 fields:

[source,r]
----

> names(df)

[1] "file"     "fullPath" "text"
----

Next we'll run the sentiment analysis function - +++<cite>+++syuzhet#get_nrc_sentiment+++</cite>+++ - over the data frame and get a score for each type of sentiment for each entry:

[source,r]
----

get_nrc_sentiment(df$text) %>% head()

  anger anticipation disgust fear joy sadness surprise trust negative positive
1     7           14       5    7   8       6        6    12       14       27
2    11           12       2   13   9      10        4    11       22       24
3     6           12       3    8   7       7        5    13       16       21
4     5           17       4    7  10       6        7    13       16       37
5     4           13       3    7   7       9        5    14       16       25
6     7           11       5    7   8       8        6    15       16       26
----

Now we'll merge these columns into our original data frame:

[source,r]
----

df = cbind(df, get_nrc_sentiment(df$text))
df$date = ymd(sapply(df$file, function(file) unlist(strsplit(file, "[.]"))[1]))
df %>% select(-text, -fullPath, -file) %>% head()

  anger anticipation disgust fear joy sadness surprise trust negative positive       date
1     7           14       5    7   8       6        6    12       14       27 2016-01-02
2    11           12       2   13   9      10        4    11       22       24 2016-01-03
3     6           12       3    8   7       7        5    13       16       21 2016-01-04
4     5           17       4    7  10       6        7    13       16       37 2016-01-05
5     4           13       3    7   7       9        5    14       16       25 2016-01-06
6     7           11       5    7   8       8        6    15       16       26 2016-01-07
----

Finally we can build some 'sentiment over time' charts like Julia has in her post:

[source,r]
----

posnegtime <- df %>%
  group_by(date = cut(date, breaks="1 week")) %>%
  summarise(negative = mean(negative), positive = mean(positive)) %>%
  melt

names(posnegtime) <- c("date", "sentiment", "meanvalue")
posnegtime$sentiment = factor(posnegtime$sentiment,levels(posnegtime$sentiment)[c(2,1)])

ggplot(data = posnegtime, aes(x = as.Date(date), y = meanvalue, group = sentiment)) +
  geom_line(size = 2.5, alpha = 0.7, aes(color = sentiment)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  ylim(0, NA) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("springgreen4", "firebrick3")) +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_date(breaks = date_breaks("1 month"), labels = date_format("%b %Y")) +
  ylab("Average sentiment score") +
  ggtitle("Sentiment Over Time")
----

So overall it seems like my writing displays more positive sentiment than negative which is nice to know. The chart shows a rolling one week average and there isn't a single week where there's more negative sentiment than positive.

I thought it'd be fun to drill into the highest negative and positive days to see what was going on there:

[source,r]
----

> df %>% filter(negative == max(negative)) %>% select(date)

        date
1 2016-03-19

> df %>% filter(positive == max(positive)) %>% select(date)

        date
1 2016-01-05
2 2016-06-20
----

On the 19th March I was really frustrated because my boiler had broken down and I had to buy a new one - I'd completely forgotten how annoyed I was, so thanks sentiment analysis for reminding me!

I couldn't find anything particularly positive on the 5th January or 20th June. The 5th January was the day after my birthday so perhaps I was happy about that but I couldn't see any particular evidence that was the case.

Playing around with the +++<cite>+++get_nrc_sentiment+++</cite>+++ function it does seem to identify positive sentiment when I wouldn't say there is any. For example here's some example sentences from my writing today:

[source,r]
----

> get_nrc_sentiment("There was one section that I didn't quite understand so will have another go at reading that.")

  anger anticipation disgust fear joy sadness surprise trust negative positive
1     0            0       0    0   0       0        0     0        0        1
----

[source,r]
----

> get_nrc_sentiment("Bit of a delay in starting my writing for the day...for some reason was feeling wheezy again.")

  anger anticipation disgust fear joy sadness surprise trust negative positive
1     2            1       2    2   1       2        1     1        2        2
----

I don't think there's any positive sentiment in either of those sentences but the function claims 3 bits of positive sentiment! It would be interesting to see if I fare any better with https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/syuzhet/vignettes/syuzhet-vignette.html[Stanford's sentiment extraction tool which you can use with syuzhet] but requires a bit of setup first.

I'll give that a try next but in terms of getting an overview of my mood I thought I might get a better picture if I looked for the difference between positive and negative sentiment rather than absolute values.

The following code does the trick:

[source,R]
----

difftime <- df %>%
  group_by(date = cut(date, breaks="1 week")) %>%
  summarise(diff = mean(positive) - mean(negative))

ggplot(data = difftime, aes(x = as.Date(date), y = diff)) +
  geom_line(size = 2.5, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  ylim(0, NA) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("springgreen4", "firebrick3")) +
  theme(legend.title=element_blank(), axis.title.x = element_blank()) +
  scale_x_date(breaks = date_breaks("1 month"), labels = date_format("%b %Y")) +
  ylab("Average sentiment difference score") +
  ggtitle("Sentiment Over Time")
----

This one identifies peak happiness in mid January/February. We can find the peak day for this measure as well:

[source,r]
----

> df %>% mutate(diff = positive - negative) %>% filter(diff == max(diff)) %>% select(date)

        date
1 2016-02-25
----

Or if we want to see the individual scores:

[source,R]
----

> df %>% mutate(diff = positive - negative) %>% filter(diff == max(diff)) %>% select(-text, -file, -fullPath)

  anger anticipation disgust fear joy sadness surprise trust negative positive       date diff
1     0           11       2    3   7       1        6     6        3       31 2016-02-25   28
----

After reading through the entry for this day I'm wondering if the individual pieces of sentiment might be more interesting than the positive/negative score.

On the 25th February I was:

* quite excited about reading a distributed systems book I'd just bought (I know?!)
* thinking about how to apply the http://tagging.pui.ch/automated_tag_clustering[tag clustering technique] to meetup topics
* preparing https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGCCVNlZmRI[my submission to PyData London] and thinking about what was gonna go in it
* thinking about the soak testing we were about to start doing on our project
+
</ul>
+
Each of those is a type of anticipation so it makes sense that this day scores highly. I looked through some other days which specifically rank highly for anticipation and couldn't figure out what I was anticipating so even this is a bit hit and miss!
+
I have a few avenues to explore further but if you have any other ideas for what I can try next let me know in the comments.
