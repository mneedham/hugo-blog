I've been working on a https://reach.tech/router[React Reach Router^] based application that has several routes and wanted to show a search box in the header unless the user was on the search page.
After a lot of trial and error I learnt that I could use a route change event listener to do this.

The CodeSandbox below shows all the code to do this:

Let's walk through the code.
We have a top level component called `App` that has the state `showSearchBox`, which defaults to `true`:

[source,javascript]
----
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {globalHistory, Link, Router} from "@reach/router";

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      showSearchBox: true
    };
  }
}
----

In our render function we display an input box only if this value is set to `true`:

[source,javascript]
----
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <p>
            React Reach Router Demo
          </p>
          <div>
            {this.state.showSearchBox && <input type={"text"} style={{margin: "10px"}}/>}
          </div>
        </header>
        <nav style={{padding: "5px"}}>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link> <Link to="dashboard">Dashboard</Link> <Link to="search">Search</Link>
        </nav>
        <div style={{paddingTop: "10px"}}>
          <Router>
            <Home path="/"/>
            <Dashboard path="/dashboard"/>
            <Search path="/search"/>
          </Router>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
----

In this code sample we can also see that we have 3 paths:

* `/`
* `/dashboard` and
* `/search`

We want to set `showSearchBox` to `false` if we're on the `/search` route, but set to `true` on any of the other routes.

I initially tried to control this state from the child components, without much success.
The closest I got was a maximum update depth exceeded error, which wasn't great.

By chance I came across a https://github.com/reach/router/issues/262[GitHub issue^] created by Marvin Heilemann, in which he asked whether there was a hook to capture route change events.
And indeed there is.

We can update our `App` component to listen to these events and update the `showSearchBox` state by adding the following functions:

[source, javascript]
----
class App extends Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.toggleSearchBox(globalHistory.location)

    this.historyUnsubscribe = globalHistory.listen(({action, location}) => {
      if (action === 'PUSH') {
        this.toggleSearchBox(location)
      }
    });
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.historyUnsubscribe();
  }

  toggleSearchBox(location) {
    if (location.pathname === "/search") {
      this.setState({
        showSearchBox: false
      })
    } else {
      this.setState({
        showSearchBox: true
      })
    }
  }
}
----

In `componentDidMount` we also make sure that we toggle the search box based on the URL that we start on as well, otherwise it would default to `true`.

If we try the CodeSandbox provided at the top of the post we'll see the following if we click the `Dashboard` link in the header:

image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2019/12/dashboard.png[]

As expected, the search box is still showing.
But if we click the `Search` link, we'll see the following screen:

image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2019/12/search.png[]

After I'd got this working I came across https://github.com/reach/router/issues/203[another GitHub issue^], where Martin Mende showed how to achieve the same thing https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html[using state and effect hooks^].
The following code does the same thing as the `App` component that we defined above:

[source, javascript]
----
import React, {useEffect, useState} from 'react';
import {globalHistory, Link, Router} from "@reach/router";

function App() {
  const initialState = true;
  const [showSearchBox, setShowSearchBox] = useState(initialState);
  useEffect(() => {
    const removeListener = globalHistory.listen(params => {
      const { location } = params;
      const newState = location.pathname !== "/search";
      setShowSearchBox(newState);
    });
    return () => {
      removeListener();
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <p>React Reach Router Demo</p>
        <div>
          {showSearchBox && <input type={"text"} style={{ margin: "10px" }} />}
        </div>
      </header>
      <nav style={{ padding: "5px" }}>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link> <Link to="dashboard">Dashboard</Link>{" "}
        <Link to="search">Search</Link>
      </nav>
      <div style={{ paddingTop: "10px" }}>
        <Router>
          <Home path="/" />
          <Dashboard path="/dashboard" />
          <Search path="/search" />
        </Router>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
