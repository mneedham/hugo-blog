I've been using Neo4j's https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-apoc-procedures/[APOC^] library to load some local JSON files this week, and ran into an interesting problem.

The `LOAD CSV` tool assumes that any files you load locally are in the `import` directory, so I've got into the habit of putting my data there.
Let's check what I'm trying to import by opening the import directory:

What's in there?

Just the one JSON file needs processing.
If we want to import local files we need to add the following property to our Neo4j configuration file:

[source, text]
----
apoc.import.file.enabled=true
----

If you're using the Neo4j Desktop, you can add this property via the 'Settings' tab:

Once we've done that we'll need to restart the database so our new settings will be picked up:

Now let's try to process our JSON file:

[source, cypher]
----
neo4j> CALL apoc.load.json("file:///dummy.json");
Failed to invoke procedure `apoc.load.json`: Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: Can't read url or key file:/dummy.json as json: /dummy.json (No such file or directory)
----

Hmm, that didn't work as we expected - it seems to be trying to read the file from the root of the machine rather than from the `import` directory.
It turns out I hadn't RTFM:

image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2019/01/local-files.png[]

Let's update our Neo4j configuration file to add the following property:

[source, text]
----
apoc.import.file.use_neo4j_config=true
----

If we re-run our query we'll see that it now finds and processes the file:
