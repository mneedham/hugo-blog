I want to graph my Google Timeline to try and see what I get up to with my days.

== How do we get the data?

You can easily download your timeline for a single day by selecting the 'Export this day to KML' option from the https://www.google.com/maps/timeline?pb=!1m2!1m1!1s2019-01-12[user interface^]:

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an easy way to download all the days though, but luckily Alexandre Attia has https://medium.com/alex-attia-blog/how-to-take-back-control-and-use-your-google-maps-data-683fb5d4043e[figured out how to do it^].
