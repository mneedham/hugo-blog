In https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial/details/part-3-more-fun-with-word-vectors[part 3 of Kaggle's series on text analytics] I needed to install http://scikit-learn.org/stable/[scikit-learn] and having done so ran into the following error when trying to use one of its classes:

[source,python]
----

>>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/Users/markneedham/projects/neo4j-himym/himym/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/__init__.py", line 37, in <module>
    from . import __check_build
ImportError: cannot import name __check_build
----

This error doesn't reveal very much but I found that when I exited the REPL and tried the same command again I got a different error which was a bit more useful:

[source,python]
----

>>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/Users/markneedham/projects/neo4j-himym/himym/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/__init__.py", line 38, in <module>
    from .base import clone
  File "/Users/markneedham/projects/neo4j-himym/himym/lib/python2.7/site-packages/sklearn/base.py", line 10, in <module>
    from scipy import sparse
ImportError: No module named scipy
----

The fix for this is now obvious:

[source,python]
----

$ pip install scipy
----

And I can now load +++<cite>+++CountVectorizer+++</cite>+++ without any problem:

[source,python]
