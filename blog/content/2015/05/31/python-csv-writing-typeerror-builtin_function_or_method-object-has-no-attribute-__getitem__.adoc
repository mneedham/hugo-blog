title="Python: CSV writing - TypeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute '*getitem*'"
tag=['python']
category=['Python']
+++

When I'm working in Python I often find myself writing to CSV files using the https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html[in built library] and every now and then make a mistake when calling writerow:

[source,python]
----

import csv
writer = csv.writer(file, delimiter=",")
writer.writerow["player", "team"]
----

This results in the following error message:

[source,text]
----

TypeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute '__getitem__'
----

The error message is a bit weird at first but it's basically saying that I've tried to do an http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13075632/typeerror-builtin-function-or-method-object-has-no-attribute-getitem[associative lookup on an object which doesn't support that operation].

The resolution is simply to include the appropriate parentheses instead of leaving them out!

[source,python]
----

writer.writerow(["player", "team"])
----

This one's for future Mark.
