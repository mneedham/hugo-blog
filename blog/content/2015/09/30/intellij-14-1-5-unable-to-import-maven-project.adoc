It seems like this is a recent issue in the 14.x series and luckily is http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30569909/unable-to-import-maven-project-in-intellij14[reasonably easy to fix] by https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-140208[adding the following flag] to the VM options passed to the Maven importer:

[source,text]
----

-Didea.maven3.use.compat.resolver
