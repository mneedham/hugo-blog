I've been playing around with the http://data.gov.uk/dataset/road-accidents-safety-data[Road Safety open data set] and the download comes with several CSV files and an excel spreadsheet containing the legend.

There are 45 sheets in total and each of them looks like this:

I wanted to create a CSV file for each sheet so that I can import the data set into Neo4j using the http://neo4j.com/docs/stable/query-load-csv.html[LOAD CSV command].

I came across the http://www.python-excel.org/[Python Excel website] which pointed me at the +++<cite>+++xlrd+++</cite>+++ library since I'm working with a pre 2010 Excel file.

The https://secure.simplistix.co.uk/svn/xlrd/trunk/xlrd/doc/xlrd.html?p=4966#sheet.Cell-class[main documentation is very extensive] but I found the https://github.com/python-excel/xlrd[github example] much easier to follow.

I ended up with the following script which iterates through all but the first two sheets in the spreadsheet - the first two sheets contain instructions rather than data:

[source,python]
----

from xlrd import open_workbook
import csv

wb = open_workbook('Road-Accident-Safety-Data-Guide-1979-2004.xls')

for i in range(2, wb.nsheets):
    sheet = wb.sheet_by_index(i)
    print sheet.name
    with open("data/%s.csv" %(sheet.name.replace(" ","")), "w") as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file, delimiter = ",")
        print sheet, sheet.name, sheet.ncols, sheet.nrows

        header = [cell.value for cell in sheet.row(0)]
        writer.writerow(header)

        for row_idx in range(1, sheet.nrows):
            row = [int(cell.value) if isinstance(cell.value, float) else cell.value
                   for cell in sheet.row(row_idx)]
            writer.writerow(row)
----

I've replaced spaces in the sheet name so that the file name on a disk is a bit easier to work with. For some reason the numeric values were all floats whereas I wanted them as ints so I had to explicitly apply that transformation.

Here are a few examples of what the CSV files look like:

[source,bash]
----

$ cat data/1stPointofImpact.csv
code,label
0,Did not impact
1,Front
2,Back
3,Offside
4,Nearside
-1,Data missing or out of range

$ cat data/RoadType.csv
code,label
1,Roundabout
2,One way street
3,Dual carriageway
6,Single carriageway
7,Slip road
9,Unknown
12,One way street/Slip road
-1,Data missing or out of range

$ cat data/Weather.csv
code,label
1,Fine no high winds
2,Raining no high winds
3,Snowing no high winds
4,Fine + high winds
5,Raining + high winds
6,Snowing + high winds
7,Fog or mist
8,Other
9,Unknown
-1,Data missing or out of range
----

And that's it. Not too difficult!
