I'm planning to write a variant of the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf[TF/IDF] algorithm over the HIMYM corpus which weights in favour of term that appear in a medium number of documents and as a prerequisite needed a function that when given a number of documents would return a weighting.

It should return a higher value when a term appears in a medium number of documents i.e. if I pass in 10 I should get back a higher value than 200 as a term that appears in 10 episodes is likely to be more interesting than one which appears in almost every episode.

I went through a few different scipy distributions but none of them did exactly what I want so I ended up writing a sampling function which http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24854965/create-random-numbers-with-left-skewed-probability-distribution[chooses random numbers in a range with different probabilities]:

[source,python]
----

import math
import numpy as np

values = range(1, 209)
probs = [1.0 / 208] * 208

for idx, prob in enumerate(probs):
    if idx > 3 and idx < 20:
        probs[idx] = probs[idx] * (1 + math.log(idx + 1))
    if idx > 20 and idx < 40:
        probs[idx] = probs[idx] * (1 + math.log((40 - idx) + 1))

probs = [p / sum(probs) for p in probs]
sample =  np.random.choice(values, 1000, p=probs)

>>> print sample[:10]
[ 33   9  22 126  54   4  20  17  45  56]
----

Now let's visualise the distribution of this sample by plotting a histogram:

[source,python]
----

import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('TkAgg')
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

binwidth = 2
plt.hist(sample, bins=np.arange(min(sample), max(sample) + binwidth, binwidth))
plt.xlim([0, max(sample)])
plt.show()

It's a bit hacky but it does seem to work in terms of weighting the values correctly. It would be nice if it I could smooth it off a bit better but I'm not sure how at the moment.

One final thing we can do is get the count of any one of the values by using the http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.bincount.html[bincount] function:

[source,python]
----

>>> print np.bincount(sample)[1]
4

>>> print np.bincount(sample)[10]
16

>>> print np.bincount(sample)[206]
3
----

Now I need to plug this into the rest of my code and see if it actually works!
