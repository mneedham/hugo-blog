Earlier this evening I found myself writing the equivalent of the following Python code while building a stop list for a topic model\...

[source,python]
----

words = ["mark", "neo4j", "michael"]
word_position = 0
for word in words:
   print word_position, word
   word_position +=1
----

\...which is very foolish given that there's https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#enumerate[already a function] that makes it really easy to grab the position of an item in a list:

[source,python]
----

for word_position, word in enumerate(words):
   print word_position, word
----

Python does make things extremely easy at times - you're welcome future Mark!
