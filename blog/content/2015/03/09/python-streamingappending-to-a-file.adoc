title="Python: Streaming/Appending to a file"

I've been playing around with Twitter's API (via the https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy[tweepy] library) and due to the rate limiting it imposes I wanted to stream results to a CSV file rather than waiting until my whole program had finished.

I wrote the following program to simulate what I was trying to do:

[source,python]
----

import csv
import time

with open("rows.csv", "a") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file, delimiter = ",")

    end = time.time() + 10
    while True:
        if time.time() > end:
            break
        else:
            writer.writerow(["mark", "123"])
            time.sleep(1)
----

The program will run for 10 seconds and append one line to 'rows.csv' once a second. Although I have used the 'a' flag in my call to 'open' if I poll that file before the 10 seconds is up it's empty:

[source,bash]
----

$ date && wc -l rows.csv
Mon  9 Mar 2015 22:54:27 GMT
       0 rows.csv

$ date && wc -l rows.csv
Mon  9 Mar 2015 22:54:31 GMT
       0 rows.csv

$ date && wc -l rows.csv
Mon  9 Mar 2015 22:54:34 GMT
       0 rows.csv

$ date && wc -l rows.csv
Mon  9 Mar 2015 22:54:43 GMT
      10 rows.csv
----

I thought the flushing of the file was completely controlled by the with block but lucky for me there's actually a +++<cite>+++https://docs.python.org/2/library/io.html#io.IOBase.flush[flush()]+++</cite>+++ function which allows me to force writes to the file whenever I want.

Here's the new and improved sample program:

[source,python]
----

import csv
import time

with open("rows.csv", "a") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file, delimiter = ",")

    end = time.time() + 10
    while True:
        if time.time() > end:
            break
        else:
            writer.writerow(["mark", "123"])
            time.sleep(1)
            file.flush()
----

And if we poll the file while the program's running:

[source,python]
----

$ date && wc -l rows.csv
Mon  9 Mar 2015 22:57:36 GMT
      14 rows.csv

$ date && wc -l rows.csv
Mon  9 Mar 2015 22:57:37 GMT
      15 rows.csv

$ date && wc -l rows.csv
Mon  9 Mar 2015 22:57:40 GMT
      18 rows.csv

$ date && wc -l rows.csv
Mon  9 Mar 2015 22:57:45 GMT
      20 rows.csv
----

Much easier than I expected - I â™¥ python!
