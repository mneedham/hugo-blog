I've been doing some exploration of the posts made on this blog and I thought I'd start with answering a simple question - on which dates did I write the most posts?

I started with a data frame containing each post and the date it was published:

[source,r]

> library(dplyr)
> df %>% sample_n(5)
                                                title                date

To find the most popular days for blog posts we can write the following aggregation function:

[source,r]
----

> df %>% mutate(day = as.Date(date)) %>% count(day) %>% arrange(desc(n))

Source: local data frame [1,140 x 2]

          day n
1  2012-12-31 6
2  2014-05-31 6
3  2008-08-08 5
4  2013-01-27 5
5  2009-08-24 4
6  2012-06-24 4
7  2012-09-30 4
8  2012-10-27 4
9  2012-11-24 4
10 2013-02-28 4
----

So we can see a couple of days with 6 posts, a couple with 5 posts, a few more with 4 posts and then presumably loads of days with 1 post.

I thought it'd be cool if we could blog a histogram which had on the x axis the number of posts and on the y axis how many days that number of posts occurred e.g. for an x value of 6 (posts) we'd have a y value of 2 (occurrences).

My initial attempt was this:

[source,r]
----

> df %>% mutate(day = as.Date(date)) %>% count(day) %>% count(n)
Error: cannot modify grouping variable
----

Unfortunately that isn't allowed. I tried ungrouping and then counting again:

[source,r]
----

 df %>% mutate(day = as.Date(date)) %>% count(day) %>% ungroup() %>% count(n)
Error: cannot modify grouping variable
----

Still no luck. I did a bit of googlign around and came across a post which http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30243299/dplyr-error-cannot-modify-grouping-variable-even-when-first-applying-ungroup[suggested using a combination of group_by + mutate or group_by + summarize].

I tried the mutate approach first:

[source,r]
----

> df %>% mutate(day = as.Date(date)) %>%
+     group_by(day) %>% mutate(n = n()) %>% ungroup() %>% sample_n(5)
                                                        title                Source: local data frame [5 x 4]

That keeps around the 'title' which is a bit annoying. We can get rid of it using a distinct on 'day' if we want and if we also implement the second part of the function we end up with the following:

[source,r]
----

> df %>% mutate(day = as.Date(date)) %>%
    group_by(day) %>% mutate(n = n()) %>% distinct(day) %>% ungroup() %>%
    group_by(n) %>%
    mutate(c = n()) %>%
    distinct(n)

Annoyingly we've still got the 'title', 'date' and 'day' columns hanging around which we'd need to get rid of with a call to 'select'. The code also feels quite icky, especially the use of distinct in a couple of places.

In fact we can simplify the code if we use summarize instead of mutate:

[source,r]
----

> df %>% mutate(day = as.Date(date)) %>%
    group_by(day) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% ungroup() %>%
    group_by(n) %>% summarize(c = n())


Source: local data frame [6 x 2]

  n   c
1 1 852
2 2 235
3 3  41
4 4   8
5 5   2
6 6   2
----

And we've got also rid of the extra columns in the bargain which is great! And now we can plot our histogram:

[source,r]
----

> library(ggplot2)
> post_frequencies = df %>% mutate(day = as.Date(date)) %>%
    group_by(day) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% ungroup() %>%
    group_by(n) %>% summarize(c = n())
> ggplot(aes(x = n, y = c), data = post_frequencies) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")

In this case we don't actually need to do the second grouping to create the bar chart since ggplot will do it for us if we feed it the following data:

[source,r]
----

. ggplot(aes(x = n),
         data = df %>% mutate(day = as.Date(date)) %>% group_by(day) %>% summarize(n = n()) %>% ungroup()) +
    geom_bar(binwidth = 1) +
    scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1, 6))

Still, it's good to know how!
