title="Python: Difference between two datetimes in milliseconds"

I've been doing a bit of adhoc measurement of some cypher queries executed via http://py2neo.org/2.0/[py2neo] and wanted to work out how many milliseconds each query was taking end to end.

I thought there'd be an obvious way of doing this but if there is it's evaded me so far and I ended up http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1345827/how-do-i-find-the-time-difference-between-two-datetime-objects-in-python[calculating the different between two _datetime_ objects] which gave me the following timedelta object: ~~~python >>> import datetime >>> start = datetime.datetime.now() >>> end = datetime.datetime.now() >>> end - start datetime.timedelta(0, 3, 519319) ~~~

The 3 parts of this object are 'days', 'seconds' and 'microseconds' which I found quite strange!

These are the methods/attributes we have available to us: ~~~python >>> dir(end - start) ['__abs__', '__add__', '__class__', '__delattr__', '__div__', '__doc__', '__eq__', '__floordiv__', '__format__', '__ge__', '__getattribute__', '__gt__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__le__', '__lt__', '__mul__', '__ne__', '__neg__', '__new__', '__nonzero__', '__pos__', '__radd__', '__rdiv__', '__reduce__', '__reduce_ex__', '__repr__', '__rfloordiv__', '__rmul__', '__rsub__', '__setattr__', '__sizeof__', '__str__', '__sub__', '__subclasshook__', 'days', 'max', 'microseconds', 'min', 'resolution', 'seconds', 'total_seconds'] ~~~

There's no 'milliseconds' on there so we'll have to calculate it from what we do have: ~~~python >>> diff = end - start >>> elapsed_ms = (diff.days * 86400000) + (diff.seconds * 1000) + (diff.microseconds / 1000) >>> elapsed_ms 3519 ~~~

Or we could do the following slightly simpler calculation: ~~~python >>> diff.total_seconds() * 1000 3519.319 ~~~

And now back to the query profiling!
