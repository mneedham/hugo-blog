While in DuckDB land, I wanted to create a list of numbers, just like you can with Cypher's https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/list/#functions-range[`range`^] function.
After a bit of searching that resulted in very complex solutions, I came across the Postgres https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-srf.html[`generate_series`^] function, which does the trick.

We can use it in place of a table, like this:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT * 
FROM generate_series(1, 10)
----

[options="header"]
.Output
|===
|generate_series
|1
|2
|3
|4
|5
|6
|7
|8
|9
|10
|===

As you can see from the results, this returns 10 rows with one number per row.

Alternatively, we can use it inside a `SELECT` clause, like this:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT generate_series(1, 10)
----

[options="header"]
.Output
|===
|generate_series(1, 10)
|[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
|===

This time it returns one row with an array containing 10 values.

I later learnt that this function is also aliased as https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/functions/nested.html#range-functions[`range`^], exactly like the Cypher function that I mentioned at the beginning of the post.
We can also define the step when generating the range of numnbers, like this:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT range(1, 10, 2)
----

[options="header"]
.Output
|===
|generate_series(1, 10)
|[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
|===
