In this blog post we're going to learn how to write a SQL query to join two tables where one of the tables has multiple rows for each key.
We want to select only the rows that contain the most recent (or maximum) value from that table.

Our story begins with a https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogge3kmm_2g[YouTube video^] that I created showing how to query the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer[European Soccer SQLite database^] with DuckDB.
This database contains lots of different tables, but we are only interested in `Player` and `Player_Attributes`.

Let's have a quick look at the structure of those tables:

[source,sql]
----
DESCRIBE Player;
----

.Output
[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
column_name,column_type,null,key,default,extra
id,BIGINT,YES,,,
player_api_id,BIGINT,YES,,,
player_name,VARCHAR,YES,,,
player_fifa_api_id,BIGINT,YES,,,
birthday,VARCHAR,YES,,,
height,FLOAT,YES,,,
weight,BIGINT,YES,,,
|===

[source,sql]
----
DESCRIBE Player_Attributes;
----

.Output

Let's start by writing a query that finds the `overall_rating` for Lionel Messi by joining the `Player` and `Player_Attributes` tables:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT date, overall_rating
FROM Player
JOIN Player_Attributes ON Player_Attributes.player_api_id = Player.player_api_id
WHERE PLayer.player_name = 'Lionel Messi'
LIMIT 10;
----

.Output
[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
date,overall_rating
"2015-12-17 00:00:00",94
"2015-10-16 00:00:00",94
"2015-09-21 00:00:00",94
"2015-06-26 00:00:00",93
"2015-03-13 00:00:00",93
"2015-02-20 00:00:00",93
"2015-01-23 00:00:00",93
"2014-10-17 00:00:00",93
"2014-09-18 00:00:00",93
"2014-04-25 00:00:00",94
|===

We can see that there are at least 10 entries for Messi in the `Player_Attributes` table.
We only want the most recent ranking, which we can do by using a windowing operation that numbers each row and selects the first one.

We can write the following query to find the top 10 players ordered by their most recent ranking:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT player_name, overall_rating
FROM Player
JOIN (
    select *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (partition by player_api_id ORDER BY date DESC) rn
    FROM Player_Attributes
) AS attrs ON attrs.player_api_id = Player.player_api_id AND rn = 1
WHERE overall_rating is not null
ORDER BY overall_rating DESC
LIMIT 10;
----

.Output
[format="csv", options="header"]
|===
player_name,overall_rating
"Lionel Messi",94
"Cristiano Ronaldo",93
"Luis Suarez",90
Neymar,90
"Manuel Neuer",90
"Zlatan Ibrahimovic",89
"Arjen Robben",89
"Andres Iniesta",88
"Mesut Oezil",88
"Eden Hazard",88

This is the query that I included in the video and I didn't know there was a better way until https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7022269018371682304?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7022269018371682304%2C7023816359096573952%29&dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287023816359096573952%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7022269018371682304%29[Richard Wesley wrote me the following message^], suggesting that I used the `arg_max` function instead.

I'd not come across this function before, but I updated my query to use it:

[source, sql]
----
SELECT player_name, arg_max(overall_rating, date) AS overall_rating
FROM Player
JOIN Player_Attributes ON Player_Attributes.player_api_id = Player.player_api_id
GROUP BY ALL
ORDER BY overall_rating DESC
LIMIT 10;
----

The results are the same as with the other query and I can also get rid of the `WHERE overall_rating is not null` clause, which is great.

Thanks Richard!
