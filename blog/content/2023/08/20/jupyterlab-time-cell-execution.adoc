I've been using Jupyter Lab notebooks in some of my recent videos on https://www.youtube.com/@learndatawithmark/videos[Learn Data with Mark^] and I wanted to show cell execution timings so that viewers would have an idea of how long things were taking.
I thought I'd need to use a custom timer, but it turns out there's quite a nice plug-in, which we'll learn about in this blog post.

The plug-in is called https://github.com/deshaw/jupyterlab-execute-time[`jupyterlab-execute-time`^] and it shows a live view of the time that a cell takes to execute, as well as showing the execution time afterward.

We can install the library directly using pip:

[source, bash]
----
pip install jupyterlab_execute_time
----

Or Poetry, if that's your thing:

[source, bash]
----
poetry add jupyterlab_execute_time
----

Alternatively, we can use the extension manager inside Jupyter Lab, which you can launch by typing `Cmd + Shift + X` on a Mac.
Once it pops up, search for `jupyterlab-execute-time`, as shown below:

And then click on 'Install'.

Regardless of the installation option used, you should then see the plugin under the 'Installed' section:

And here's a screenshot showing the timings for a few cells in a notebook that I'm currently working on:
