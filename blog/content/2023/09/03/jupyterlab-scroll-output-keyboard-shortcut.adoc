In the latest version of Jupyter Notebook/Lab (at least), the output of each cell is shown in full, regardless of how long it is.
I wanted to limit the height of the output and then scroll through it within that inner window, ideally by triggering a keyboard shortcut.

I learnt how to do this with the help of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59025144/how-do-i-set-a-shortcut-to-enable-scrolling-for-outputs-in-jupyter-lab[Stack Overflow].
First, you need to open the settings editor by typing `Cmd + ,` on a Mac or by clicking on that screen from the top menu:

.Settings > Settings Editor

Next, click on `JSON Settings Editor` in the top right-hand corner:

.JSON Settings Editor

And then paste the following JSON into the `shortcuts` array:

[source, json]
----
        {
            "command": "notebook:enable-output-scrolling",
            "keys": [
                "S"
            ],
            "selector": ".jp-Notebook:focus",
            "args": {}
        },
        {
            "command": "notebook:disable-output-scrolling",
            "keys": [
                "Alt S"
            ],
            "selector": ".jp-Notebook:focus",
            "args": {}
        },
----

This is how it should look like once you've done that:

You can then add a scrollbar to an output cell by pressing `s` or remove the scrollbar by pressing `Alt + s`.
Below is an example of what happens when you toggle output scrolling:
