I've been playing around with the https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hugomathien/soccer[Kaggle European Soccer dataset^], which contains, amongst other things, players and their stats in the FIFA video game.
I wanted to compare the stats of Ronaldo and Messi, which is where this story begins.

[NOTE]
====
I've created a video showing how to do this on https://www.youtube.com/@learndatawithmark[my YouTube channel, Learn Data with Mark^], so if you prefer to consume content through that medium, I've embedded it below:

We will of course be using DuckDB and since the dataset is a SQLite database, we'll need to install the SQLite extension"

[source, sql]
----
INSTALL sqlite;
LOAD sqlite;
----

Next, let's create tables for `Player` and `Player_Attribute`:

[source, sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE Player (
    id BIGINT,
    player_api_id BIGINT,
    player_name VARCHAR,
    player_fifa_api_id BIGINT,
    birthday VARCHAR,
    height float,
    weight BIGINT
);
INSERT INTO Player
FROM sqlite_scan('database.sqlite', 'Player');

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE Player_Attributes AS
FROM sqlite_scan('database.sqlite', 'Player_Attributes');
----

I want to join these two tables together and get the latest stat for each player, which we can do by creating the following view that uses a window function:

[source, sql]
----
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW PlayerStats AS 
FROM Player
JOIN (
    select *, 
           ROW_NUMBER() 
           OVER (partition by player_api_id ORDER BY date DESC) rn
    FROM Player_Attributes
) AS attrs ON attrs.player_api_id = Player.player_api_id AND rn = 1
SELECT * EXCLUDE(rn, id, player_api_id, player_fifa_api_id);
----

If we want to find the stats for one player, we can write a query like this:

[source, sql]
----
FROM PlayerStats WHERE player_name = 'Cristiano Ronaldo';
----

.Output
[options="header"]
|===
|Player Name |Birthday |Height |Weight |... |GK Handling |GK Kicking |GK Positioning |GK Reflexes
|Cristiano Ronaldo |1985-02-05 00:00:00 |185.42 |176 |... |11 |15 |14 |11
|===

We can see from the `...` that some of the columns have been truncated. 
This table has only 9 columns, but there are more than 30 different stats for each player.
We'd need a very wide monitor to be able to see all of those in one go.

Alternatively, we could display the stats vertically, which is where the `UNPIVOT` function comes in.
We can write the following query to see Ronaldo's stats as rows instead of columns:

[source, sql]
----
UNPIVOT (FROM PlayerStats WHERE player_name = 'Cristiano Ronaldo')
ON COLUMNS (*)
INTO NAME stat1 VALUE "Cristiano Ronaldo";
----

.Output

|==========================================

That's much easier to read.
And if we want to compare Ronaldo's stats against another play, say, Lionel Messi, we can JOIN `UNPIVOT` clauses together:

[source, sql]
----
FROM (
    UNPIVOT (FROM PlayerStats WHERE player_name = 'Cristiano Ronaldo')
    ON COLUMNS (*)
    INTO NAME stat1 VALUE "Cristiano Ronaldo"
) p1
JOIN (
    UNPIVOT (FROM PlayerStats WHERE player_name = 'Lionel Messi')
    ON COLUMNS (*)
    INTO NAME stat2 VALUE "Lionel Messi"
) p2 ON p1.stat1 = p2.stat2
SELECT stat1 AS stat, * EXCLUDE(stat1, stat2);
----

.Output
