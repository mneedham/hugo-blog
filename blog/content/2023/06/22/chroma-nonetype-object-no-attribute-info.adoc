Following on from https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2023/06/21/chroma-index-not-found-create-instance-querying/[a blog post that I wrote yesterday^] about doing similarity search with ChromaDB, I noticed an odd error message being printed as the script was exiting.
In this blog post, we'll explore what was going on.

To recap, I have the following code to find chunks of YouTube transcripts that are most similar to an input query:

.test_chroma.py
[source, python]
----
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import Chroma

hf_embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name='sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
store = Chroma(collection_name="transcript", persist_directory="db", embedding_function=hf_embeddings)

result = store.similarity_search("Who is Tim Berglund?", top_n=2)
for row in result:
  print(row)
----

When I run this script by typing `python test_chroma.py`, after the similar documents are printed, I get the following exception:

.Output
[source, text]
----
Exception ignored in: <function PersistentDuckDB.__del__ at 0x2abfe39c0>
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/markhneedham/projects/docs-bot/env/lib/python3.11/site-packages/chromadb/db/duckdb.py", line 445, in __del__
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'info'
----

I came across the following https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma/issues/364[GitHub thread^] that was discussing the issue and one suggested fix was to set `store = None` at the end of the script:

[source, python]
----
store = None
----

This did indeed work, but further down the thread it was suggested that the bug is fixed in the latest version of Chroma.
I checked my version:

[source, bash]
----
pip freeze | grep chroma
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
chromadb==0.3.21
----

A https://pypi.org/project/chromadb/[quick check on PyPi^] revealed that the latest version is actually 0.3.26, so let's update our version:


[source, bash]
----
pip install --upgrade chromadb
----

Let's check our version:

[source, bash]
----
pip freeze | grep chroma
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
chromadb==0.3.26
----

If I delete the `store = None` line and re-run the script again, the issue has been fixed and I don't get an error message.
