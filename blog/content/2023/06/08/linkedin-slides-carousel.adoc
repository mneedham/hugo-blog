If you've been using LinkedIn recently, you've likely seen those posts where people post slides in a kind of carousel that you can horizontally scroll.
I wanted to create one to explain Apache Pinot's Upserts feature, but I wasn't sure how to create one.

Since it's 2023, I started by asking ChatGPT:

.ChatGPT doesn't know about LinkedIn Carousel

Unfortunately ChatGPT doesn't know how to do it, but https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrison-avisto-42996077/[Harrison Avisto^] does and was happy to teach me.

The basic idea is that you need to upload a PDF when you're creating your post, as showing in the animation below:

So the next question is, how do you go about creating those PDFs?
I'm sure there are lots of ways to do this, but I've come across two that I think are pretty accessible.

The first is to create a 'LinkedIn Carousel' using https://www.canva.com/[canva.com] and you can do this on a free account.

You can then create a bunch of images and then download as PDF, as shown below:

If you don't want to use canva, you can do a similar thing with Google Slides.
Create a new slides document as normal and then go to `File > Page Setup` and change the dimensions of the slide/canvas:

Again, create slides like normal and export as PDF when you're done.

And here's the one I made:
