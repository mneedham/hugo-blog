I'm using the Poetry package manager for all my Python projects these days and wanted to upgrade as library that I installed a few weeks ago.
I got myself all tangled up and wanted to write down how to do it for future me.

Let's create a simple project to demonstrate what to do:

[source, bash]
----
poetry init
----

.pyproject.toml
[source, toml]
----
[tool.poetry]
name = "update-blog"
version = "0.1.0"
description = ""
authors = ["Mark Needham <m.h.needham@gmail.com>"]
readme = "README.md"
packages = [{include = "update_blog"}]

[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.11"
duckdb = "0.8.1"


[build-system]
requires = ["poetry-core"]
build-backend = "poetry.core.masonry.api"

----

Next, we're going to add DuckDB version 0.8.1 to our project:

[source, bash]
----
poetry add duckdb@0.8.1
----

I want to update this to version 0.9.0, so I initially did this:

[source, bash]
----
poetry update duckdb 
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
Updating dependencies
Resolving dependencies... (0.4s)

No dependencies to install or update
----

Hmmm, that doesn't do anything. 
I came across https://nick.groenen.me/notes/upgrade-python-packages-to-their-latest-version-when-using-poetry/[Nick Groene's] blog post and he said you need to append `@latest` to force an update.
Let's try taht:

[source, bash]
----
poetry add duckdb@latest
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
Using version ^0.9.0 for duckdb

Updating dependencies
Resolving dependencies... (0.1s)

Package operations: 0 installs, 1 update, 0 removals

  â€¢ Updating duckdb (0.8.1 -> 0.9.0)

Writing lock file
----

Happy days!
I still don't know how to update all the dependencies for a project to the latest version so if you know how to do that, please let me know!
