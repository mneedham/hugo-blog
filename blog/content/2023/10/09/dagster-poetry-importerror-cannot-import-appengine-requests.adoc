I'm taking some tentative steps into the world of batch data pipelines and I've been following https://docs.dagster.io/integrations/duckdb/using-duckdb-with-dagster[Dagster's DuckDB tutorial] when I ran into a dependency issue that I had to work around.
In this blog post, I'll share the steps that I took in case you run into the same issue.

I'm using the https://python-poetry.org/[Poetry^] dependency management tool, but I think you'd get the same issue even if you used `pip` directly.
We're going to start by adding the following dependencies:

[source, bash]
----
poetry add dagster duckdb dagster-duckdb dagster-duckdb-pandas dagster-webserver
----

And then we'll create a file called `dagster_iris.py` that defines one asset, which ingests the Iris dataset into DuckDB.

.dagster_iris.py
[source, python]
----
from dagster_duckdb import DuckDBResource
from dagster import Definitions, asset

@asset
def iris_dataset(duckdb: DuckDBResource) -> None:
    iris_df = pd.read_csv(
        "https://docs.dagster.io/assets/iris.csv",
        names=[
            "sepal_length_cm",
            "sepal_width_cm",
            "petal_length_cm",
            "petal_width_cm",
            "species",
        ],
    )

    with duckdb.get_connection() as conn:
        conn.execute("CREATE TABLE iris.iris_dataset AS SELECT * FROM iris_df")

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[iris_dataset],
    resources={
        "duckdb": DuckDBResource(
            database="/tmp/iris.duckdb",  # required
        )
    },
)
----

Next, we're going to launch Dagster's UI so that we can materialise this asset:

[source, bash]
----
poetry run dagster dev -f dagster_iris.py
----

But we immediately run into this error:

I came across https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76175487/sudden-importerror-cannot-import-name-appengine-from-requests-packages-urlli[this thread^], which describes a way to fix it.

____
The cause is that the latest version of requests does not support urllib3 2.0.0. This is fixed in kfp-2.0.0b16 (see PR with the change), so you can either upgrade to that, or create a new image that downgrades urllib.
____

So I ran the following command:

[source, bash]
----
poetry add urllib3==1.26.15 requests-toolbelt==0.10.1
----

When I then re-run the `dagster dev` command, I can happily load the UI:
