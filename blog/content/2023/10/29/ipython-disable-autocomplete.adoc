I've been toying with the idea of using iPython as the Python REPL for videos on https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKEk670ECmteGBehmDjVSSg[@LearnDataWithMark^], but I wanted to disable the autocomplete functionality as I find it too distracting.
In this blog post, I'll show how to do it.

First, let's install iPython:

[source, bash]
----
poetry add ipython
----

And now we'll launch the iPython REPL:

[source, bash]
----
poetry run ipython
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
Python 3.11.4 (main, Jun 20 2023, 17:23:00) [Clang 14.0.3 (clang-1403.0.22.14.1)]
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 8.16.1 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.
----

Now, let's say I type `x = ` to populate a variable.
It will suggest something like the following:

.Not so helpful autocomplete

I've only just started the session so this isn't particularly useful.
I'm not sure where it's getting the suggestions from - perhaps from my previous normal Python REPL?

In any case, I want to turn them off, which we can do from the https://ipython.org/ipython-doc/3/config/intro.html[iPython configuration file^].
You can create one of those by running the following command:

[source, bash]
----
poetry run ipython profile create
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
[ProfileCreate] Generating default config file: PosixPath('/Users/markhneedham/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py')
----

If we open that file, the first few lines will read like this:

.~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py
[source, python]
----
# Configuration file for ipython.

c = get_config()  #noqa
----

To disable autocomplete, let's add the following line:

[source, python]
----
c.TerminalInteractiveShell.autosuggestions_provider = None
----

If we then close the iPython REPL and launch it again, we can try the `x = ` code fragment again:

.No autocomplete

Job done!
