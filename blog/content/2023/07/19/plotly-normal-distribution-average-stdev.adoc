I've been playing around with Microsoft's https://trueskill.org/[TrueSkill^] algorithm, which attempts to quantify the skill of a player using the Bayesian inference algorithm.
A rating in this system is a Gaussian distribution that starts with an average of 25 and a confidence of 8.333.
I wanted to visualise various ratings using Plotly and that's what we'll be doing in this blog post.

To save you from having to install TrueSkill, we're going to create a named tuple to simulate a TrueSkill `Rating` object:

[source, python]
----
from collections import namedtuple
Rating = namedtuple('Rating', ['mu', 'sigma'])

base = Rating(25, 25/3)
----

If we print that object, we'll see the following output:

.Output
[source, text]
----
Rating(mu=25, sigma=8.333333333333334)
----

To create a visualisation of this distribution, we'll need to install the following libraries:

[source, bash]
----
pip install plotly numpy scipy kaleido==0.2.1
----

Next, import the following libraries:

[source, python]
----
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import norm
import plotly.graph_objects as go
----

Next, we're going to create some values for the x-axis.
We'll use numpy's https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html[`arange`^] function to create a series of values starting from -4 standard deviations to +4 standard deviations:

[source, python]
----
x = np.arange(base.mu-4*base.sigma, base.mu+4*base.sigma, 0.001)
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
array([-8.33333333, -8.33233333, -8.33133333, ..., 58.33066667,
       58.33166667, 58.33266667])
----

Next, we're going to run scipy's probability density function over the x values for our mu and sigma values.
In other words, we're going to compute the likelihood of each of those x values for our normal distribution:

[source, python]
----
y = norm.pdf(x, base.mu, base.sigma)
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
array([1.60596271e-05, 1.60673374e-05, 1.60750513e-05, ...,
       1.60801958e-05, 1.60724796e-05, 1.60647669e-05]
----

Now that we've got x and y values, we can create a visualisation by running the following code:

[source, python]
----
fig = go.Figure()
fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=x, y=y, mode='lines', fill='tozeroy', line_color='black'))
fig.write_image("fig1.png", width=1000, height=800)
----

If we run that code, the following image will be generated:

.Normal distribution with mu=25, sigma=8.33
image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2023/07/fig1.png[]

We can then wrap that all together into a function that can take in multiple ratings:

[source, python]
----
def visualise_distribution(**kwargs):
  fig = go.Figure()
  min_x = min([r.mu-4*r.sigma for r in kwargs.values()])
  max_x = max([r.mu+4*r.sigma for r in kwargs.values()])
  x = np.arange(min_x, max_x, 0.001)
  for key, value in kwargs.items():
      y = norm.pdf(x, value.mu, value.sigma)
      fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(x=x, y=y, mode='lines', fill='tozeroy', name=key))
  fig.write_image(f"fig_{'_'.join(kwargs.keys())}.png", width=1000, height=800)
----

Let's give it a try with 3 different ratings:

[source, python]
----
visualise_distribution(p1=Rating(25, 8.333), p2=Rating(50, 4.12), p3=Rating(10, 5.7))
----

We can see the resulting image below:

.A visualisation of multiple normal distributions
image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2023/07/fig_p1_p2_p3.png[]

We can see that the curve for `p2` is much narrower than the other two, which is because we used a small sigma value.
`p1` is the default score and as a result we have the most uncertainty in that rating.
`p3` hasn't performed well and there's reasonably certainty around their low score.
