I use Docker for pretty much every demo I create and this sometimes results in me running out of IP addresses to serve all those networks.
In this blog post, we'll learn how to diagnose and solve this issue.

Our story starts with the following command on a new project:

[source, bash]
----
docker compose up
----

Usually this purs along nicely and all our components spin up just fine, but today is not our lucky day and we get the following error:


[source, bash]
----
[+] Building 0.0s (0/0)
[+] Running 1/0
 âœ˜ Network avro-ingestion  Error                  0.0s 
failed to create network avro-ingestion: Error response from daemon: could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv4 address pool among the defaults to assign to the network
----

Hmmm, we're out of IPv4 addresses, that doesn't sound too good!
We can run the following command to check how many networks we have:

[source, bash]
----
docker network ls
----

I get the following results when running it right now:

.Output
[source, bash]
----
NETWORK ID     NAME              DRIVER    SCOPE
49a68a4670a5   avro-ingestion    bridge    local
286c2a9ed537   bridge            bridge    local
e3d97260204b   filtering         bridge    local
...
8ef1a57d8df2   stock-upserts     bridge    local
a86781534e85   traffic-upserts   bridge    local
----

If you see a lot of results then it's probably the case that, like me, you've run out of local IP addresses to assign to new networks.
You can also run the following script to check which of these networks are in use by running containers:

[source, bash]
----
for network in $(docker network ls --format "{{.Name}}"); do 
    container_names=$(docker network inspect $network | 
        jq -r '.[] | .Containers[] | .Name'
    )

    echo "$network:"
    if [ -z "$container_names" ]; then
        echo -e "\tNo containers"
    else
        while IFS= read -r line
        do
            echo -e "\t$line"
        done <<< "$container_names"
    fi
done
----

If I run this, I see the following (truncated) output:

.Output
[source, text]
----
avro-ingestion:
	No containers
bridge:
	No containers
filtering:
	No containers
...
traffic-upserts:
	zookeeper-traffic-upserts
	pinot-controller-traffic-upserts
	pinot-broker-traffic-upserts
	pinot-server-traffic-upserts
	kafka-traffic-upserts

----

It's very likely that nearly all our your networks won't have any running containers, in which case you can prune them using the following command:

[source, bash]
----
docker network prune
----

You'll see the following output as it iterates through all the networks that aren't currently in use:

[source, text]
----
Deleted Networks:
avro-ingestion
filtering
...
traffic-upserts
----

And now you should be able to create a new network.
