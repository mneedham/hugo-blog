I recently came across clickhouse-local via https://www.vantage.sh/blog/clickhouse-local-vs-duckdb[this article^] in the https://motherduck.com/blog/duckdb-ecosystem-newsletter-seven/[MotherDuck monthly newsletter^] and I wanted to give it a try on my https://github.com/mneedham/xg[expected goals dataset^]. 


clickhouse Table engine is not specified in CREATE query.

CREATE TABLE shots AS (
    SELECT h AS shot
    FROM (
        SELECT * FROM file('data/*.json', 'JSONEachRow') LIMIT 1
    ) shots
    ARRAY JOIN h
    UNION ALL
    SELECT a AS shot
    FROM (
        SELECT * FROM file('data/*.json', 'JSONEachRow') LIMIT 1
    ) shots
    ARRAY JOIN a
);

CREATE  TABLE shots ENGINE = MergeTree ORDER BY tuple() AS (
    SELECT h AS shot
    FROM (
        SELECT * FROM file('data/*.json', 'JSONEachRow') LIMIT 1
    ) shots
    ARRAY JOIN h
    UNION ALL
    SELECT a AS shot
    FROM (
        SELECT * FROM file('data/*.json', 'JSONEachRow') LIMIT 1
    ) shots
    ARRAY JOIN a
);
