I've been trying out Python's https://python-poetry.org/[Poetry^] dependency management tool recently and I really like it, but couldn't figure out how to get it setup as VSCode's Python interpreter.
In this blog post, we'll learn how to do that.

One way to add the Python interpreter in VSCode is to press `Cmd+Shift+p` and then type `Python Interpreter`. 
If you select the first result, you'll see something like the following:

When I create a virtual environment directly it'll usually appear on the list, but Poetry wasn't.
I went a-searching and came across https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59882884/vscode-doesnt-show-poetry-virtualenvs-in-select-interpreter-option[a StackOverflow thread where people were experiencing the same problem^].

I tried some of the suggestions, but they mostly didn't work for me.
I did, however, realise that I'd be able to add the interpreter manually if I knew its path, which led me to https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/731[this PR^].

This led me to the following command which gives us that answer:

[source, bash]
----
poetry env info 
----

.Output
[source, text]
----

Virtualenv
Python:         3.11.4
Implementation: CPython
Path:           /Users/markhneedham/projects/duckdb-0.8/sentiment-analysis/.venv
Executable:     /Users/markhneedham/projects/duckdb-0.8/sentiment-analysis/.venv/bin/python
Valid:          True

System
Platform:   darwin
OS:         posix
Python:     3.11.4
Path:       /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11
Executable: /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.11/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin/python3.11
----

If we want to only get the path, we can pass in `--path`:

[source, bash]
----
poetry env info --path
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
/Users/markhneedham/projects/duckdb-0.8/sentiment-analysis/.venv
----

We can then pipe that to our clipboard:


[source, bash]
----
poetry env info --path | pbcopy
----

And now we can go back to the Python interpreter window and paste in the result.

Job done!
