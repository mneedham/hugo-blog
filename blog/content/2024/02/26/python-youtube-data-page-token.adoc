I've been playing around with the YouTube API to analyse comments on YouTube videos and needed to use pagination to get all the comments.
In this blog post, we'll learn how to do that.

But before we do anything, you'll need to go to https://console.developers.google.com/[console.developers.google.com^], create a project and enable YouTube Data API v3.

.YouTube Data API

Once you've done that, create an API key.

.Creating an API key
image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2024/02/create-api-key.png[width=500]

Create an environment variable that contains your API key:

[source, bash]
----
export YOUTUBE_API_KEY="your-api-key-goes-here"
----

Now we're ready to go!

You can call the YouTube API via HTTP requests, but I find it's slightly easier to use the https://sns-sdks.lkhardy.cn/python-youtube/installation/[`python-youtube`^] library, which we can install like this:

[source, bash]
----
pip install python-youtube
----

Launch a Python REPL or Jupyter Notebook and add the following imports:

[source, python]
----
from pyyoutube import Api
import os
----

Next, initialise the API:

[source, python]
----
API_KEY = os.environ.get("YOUTUBE_API_KEY")
api = Api(api_key=API_KEY)
----

And now we need to choose a video!
I really like https://www.youtube.com/@technovangelist[Matt Williams' YouTube channel^] for learning about all things related to Ollama, so let's pick one of his videos.

++++

The video ID for this video is `NNBWmIve3fQ`, which we can plug into the API like this:

[source, python]
----
VIDEO_ID = 'NNBWmIve3fQ'
ct_by_video = api.get_comment_threads(
    video_id=VIDEO_ID, 
    count=10
)
ct_by_video
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
CommentThreadListResponse(kind='youtube#commentThreadListResponse')
----

We can go down into the `CommentThreadListResponse` to find the top-level comments like this:

[source, python]
----
comments = [
    item.snippet.topLevelComment.snippet.textDisplay 
    for item in ct_by_video.items
]
comments
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
[
    'I&#39;d love to seereal metrics - speed improvement, code quality, etc? Also, am I using up 4g for each application/plugin that uses the same model?',
    'Hi. I actually play around with Ollama in vs code. So I have a question. What is the Llama coder extension for? I installed it, but couldn&#39;t figure out what it does our how to use it. Maybe i configured something wrong? But from the documentation it&#39;s also not clear how to proberly use it. So now I don&#39;t know if I does something wrong ðŸ˜¢',
    'Can you make a video on Egpu settings and using Ollama to use it, as a perfered set up?',
    'I tested pre-Release version of Continue extension for VS Code with Ollama and set deep seek as the model. <br>Amazing! I canâ€™t believe I can use such powerful AI autocomplete in my VSCode for freeâ€¦<br><br>For Free! And it works so well',
    'Before running the JavaScript code you need to run $ ollama run &lt;some model&gt; though, right?',
    'wft why white theme',
    'The age of cr@ppy software, made with the help of clueless and irresponsible AIs is coming, hold on to your chairs!',
    'There is a tremendous ammount of work Ollama team is doing &lt;3 <br>Really awesome work and ollama works like a charm. This definitely motivates me to &quot;go beyond, plus ultraaaa&quot;',
    '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNBWmIve3fQ&amp;t=170">2:50</a>: Where can I find it for vscodium?',
    'hey, cool video! could you maybe do a video about mixtral8x7b?'
]
----

So that's the first 10 comments, but what if we want to get more? 
It turns out the `CommentThreadListResponse` has a `nextPageToken` attribute, which we can use to get the next pages.

[source, python]
----
ct_by_video.nextPageToken
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
'Z2V0X25ld2VzdF9maXJzdC0tQ2dnSWdBUVZGN2ZST0JJRkNJa2dHQUFTQlFpSUlCZ0FFZ1VJblNBWUFSSUZDSWNnR0FBU0JRaW9JQmdBR0FBaURRb0xDSldXOWEwR0VLaUUtQWs='
----

Let's use that to get some more comments:

[source, python]
----
next_ct_by_video = api.get_comment_threads(
    video_id=VIDEO_ID, 
    count=10,
    page_token=ct_by_video.nextPageToken
)

[
    item.snippet.topLevelComment.snippet.textDisplay 
    for item in next_ct_by_video.items
]
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
[
    'I tried llama coder not worked <br>Continue worked. Others are flaky at best. Thanks for videos i will look more extensions and models for my need.<br><br>If you have any idea that&#39;s great <br>Q. Llama coder always said model not available but it is their and continue can use it and respond me back',
    'great content, which is the font used in vs code?',
    'my system cant handle it and it would just crash',
    'how do I do it if Ollama is on my LAN?',
    'Windows users cry in the corner.',
    'I have already paid copilot for 1 yearâ€¦.',
    'okay okay so living in the wilderness is fine but of course:<br><br>mother_natures_beauty &amp;&amp; awe &lt; Python',
    'Great content! So much here and didnâ€™t even feel rushed in the short amount of time to cover all this.',
    'Great video.  Iâ€™ve found those two extensions to be the best as well.  The small, fast model for the autocomplete.  The bigger better model for Continue.  Deepseek for both, but I havent tried Codellama.  Complete game changer for offline coding!',
    'Greetings from Victoria!'

We can keep doing that until we get to the last page, at which point `nextPageToken` won't return a value.
It's probably best to create a function to handle the paging for us and return all the comments:

[source, python]
----
def get_all_comment_threads(api, video_id, per_page=10):
    threads = []
    token = None
    while True:
        response = api.get_comment_threads(
            video_id=video_id, 
            count=per_page, 
            page_token=token
        )
        threads.append(response)
        token = response.nextPageToken
        if not token:
            break
    return threads
----

We can call the function like this:

[source, python]
----
threads = get_all_comment_threads(api, VIDEO_ID)
threads
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
[
    CommentThreadListResponse(kind='youtube#commentThreadListResponse'),
    CommentThreadListResponse(kind='youtube#commentThreadListResponse'),
    CommentThreadListResponse(kind='youtube#commentThreadListResponse'),
    CommentThreadListResponse(kind='youtube#commentThreadListResponse')
]
----

And then extract all the comments from the threads like this:


[source, python]
----
all_comments = [
    item.snippet.topLevelComment.snippet.textDisplay
    for t in threads for  item in t.items
]

len(all_comments)
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
39
----

So there are 39 top-level comments on this video, although there are many many more if we were to include replies.

And just for fun, let's try it on one of Matt Berman's videos:
