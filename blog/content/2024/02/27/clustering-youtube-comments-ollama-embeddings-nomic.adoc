One of my favourite tools in the LLM space is https://ollama.ai/[Ollama^] and if you want to learn how to use it, there's no better place than https://www.youtube.com/@technovangelist[Matt Williams' YouTube channel^].
His videos get a lot of comments and they tend to contain a treasure trove of the things that people are thinking about and the questions that they have.
Matt recently did a video about embeddings in Ollama and I thought it'd be fun to try to get a high-level overview of what's happening in the comments section.

In this blog post, we're going to do just that, following these steps:

. Get the comments for a YouTube video
. Generate an embedding for each comment
. Cluster the embeddings using hierarchical/agglomerative clustering
. Visualise the embeddings using tSNE

== Getting YouTube comments

In https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2024/02/26/python-youtube-data-page-token/[a previous blog post^], I wrote a function that gets all the top-level comments for a given video, so we're going to reuse that function in this post.
To use this function, you'll need to first go to https://console.developers.google.com/[console.developers.google.com^], create a project and enable YouTube Data API v3.

.YouTube Data API
image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2024/02/youtube-data-api.png[width=500]

Once you've done that, create an API key.

.Creating an API key
image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2024/02/create-api-key.png[width=500]

And then create an environment variable that contains the API key:

[source, bash]
----
export YOUTUBE_API_KEY="your-api-key-goes-here"
----

And then install the https://sns-sdks.lkhardy.cn/python-youtube/installation/[`python-youtube`^] library


[source, python]
----
pip install python-youtube
----

Next, we'll initialise the API class:

[source, python]
----
from pyyoutube import Api
import os

API_KEY = os.environ.get("YOUTUBE_API_KEY")
api = Api(api_key=API_KEY)
----

And finally, let's take a look at the function to get all the comment threads for a video:

[source, python]
----
def get_all_comment_threads(api, video_id, per_page=10):
    threads = []
    token = None
    while True:
        response = api.get_comment_threads(
            video_id=video_id, 
            count=per_page, 
            page_token=token
        )
        threads.append(response)
        token = response.nextPageToken
        if not token:
            break
    return threads
----

We can use the function like this to get all the top-level comments for Matt's video:

[source, python]
----
threads = get_all_comment_threads(api, "Ml179HQoy9o", per_page=100)
all_comments = [
    item.snippet.topLevelComment.snippet.textDisplay
    for t in threads for  item in t.items
]

len(all_comments), all_comments[:10]
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
(
    104,
    [
        'It&#39;s nice that these embeddings are generated much faster, but have you ran any tests to see if they&#39;re any good?',
        'Can you make a video on How vector database work? It&#39;s internal working',
        'Great video! would love to see the vector DB video as well',
        'Hi Matt . You are realy impresionante. Could you share with me a siurce Code of video example. I&#39;ll be very happy',
        'Would love a video on db options',
        'Thanks a lot for your great videos! Please make a video on &quot;how to&quot; and &quot;which&quot; of vector databases.',
        'Great content! Super useful embedding. Seems we need to use nomic API from now on for using the embedding?',
        'So are these embeddings &#39;better&#39; than some of the huggingface embeddings? Having said that the more important question is what is in that flask, i think thats what we all want to know! 😊',
        'I feel like I’m missing something because I fundamentally don’t understand the use cases for embedding',
        'Do people actually use llama2 for embeddings though?'
    ]
)
----

We've got 104 comments to work with and you can see from this sample that the comments cover a range of different things from people saying how much they enjoyed the video to others who want to know what the use case is for them. 

== Generating embeddings

Now that we've got the comments to work with, we're going to create some embeddings.
Embeddings take a piece of content and convert it into an array of floating-point numbers.

Those floating point numbers represent the semantic meaning of the content according to the embedding model's view of the world.
We don't have any idea what the individual numbers mean, but they're capturing some characteristics of the content that we've embedded.

[NOTE]
====
If you're interested in learning more about embedding algorithms, the best resource that I've come across is https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/23/embeddings/[Simon Willison's blog post^].
====

While I love arrays of floating-point numbers as much as the next developer, what makes embeddings useful is that we can compare them to each other.
For example, we could use them to https://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2024/02/11/qdrant-fast-embed-content-discovery/[find similar blog posts^], which I wrote about a few weeks ago.
Or, in our case, we can create clusters of embeddings based on their closeness in n-dimensional space.

But that's for the next section!
Let's first create the embeddings, which we're going to do using Ollama, so let's get that library installed:

[source, python]
----
pip install ollama
----

You'll also need to make sure that you've https://ollama.com/[downloaded and installed Ollama^].
If you're running on a Mac it will then be automatically running in the background, but you can also start the Ollama server manually:

[source, python]
----
ollama serve
----

.Output
[source, text]
----

time=2024-02-28T07:21:02.928Z level=INFO source=payload_common.go:146 msg="Dynamic LLM libraries [metal]"
----

Ollama supports two embedding algorithms at the time of writing - https://ollama.com/library/nomic-embed-text[Nomic Embed Text^] and https://ollama.com/library/all-minilm[all-minilm^].
https://blog.nomic.ai/posts/nomic-embed-text-v1[Nomic Embed^] got a lot of attention recently because it's the first text embedding model that's open source, uses open data, and has open training code.
That sounds like more than enough reasons to give it a try, so let's pull that down to our machine:

[source, bash]
----
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
----

Now we're ready to create some embeddings.
The Nomic algorithm has a maximum context length of 8192 - in other words, the text that we embed must not have more characters than that.
Let's quickly calculate some descriptive statistics on the number of characters in our dataset:

[source, python]
----
import statistics

comments_length = [len(c) for c in all_comments]
(
    min(comments_length), 
    max(comments_length), 
    sum(comments_length)/len(comments_length), 
    statistics.median(comments_length)
)
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
(5, 850, 160.05769230769232, 104.5)
----

We've got quite a big range here but all the comments are below the limit.
Keep in mind that the amount of times to embed some text is correlated with how many characters it has i.e. the bigger the text, the longer it takes!
We can create embeddings by running the following code:

[source, python]
----
embeddings = [
    ollama.embeddings(model='nomic-embed-text', prompt=comment)['embedding']
    for comment in all_comments
]
----

It took 2 seconds to embed all these comments on my Mac M1. 
If you ran `ollama serve`, you can see how long it took to embed each comment by looking at the logs:

.Output
[source, text]
----

----

The amount of time that it takes is quite low for us because the comments don't have many characters.
We should expect this time to go up if we embed larger chunks of text.

Now that we've got the embeddings, let's do a quick sanity check.
I'm going to nick the `cosine_similarity` from Simon Willison's blog to help out:

[source, python]
----
def cosine_similarity(a, b):
    dot_product = sum(x * y for x, y in zip(a, b))
    magnitude_a = sum(x * x for x in a) ** 0.5
    magnitude_b = sum(x * x for x in b) ** 0.5
    return dot_product / (magnitude_a * magnitude_b)
----

We're going to create an embedding for the text `Great video. I loved it` and find the most similar comments to that embedding.

[source, python]
----
search_embedding = ollama.embeddings(
    model='nomic-embed-text', 
    prompt="Great Video. I loved it."
)['embedding']

sorted([
    (comment, cosine_similarity(embedding, search_embedding))
    for comment, embedding in zip(all_comments, embeddings)
], key=lambda x: x[1]*-1)[:5]
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
[
    ('Your voice is amazing. I could listen to you present on anything man. Amazing video', 0.6389594729369522),
    ('Hi Matt, thanks for making these videos. It is very informative and helpful.', 0.6236011957217291),
    ('I really loved this video! Great and super timely topic. Yes on a Vector DB comparison video.', 0.6122029716924652),
    ('You are a great teacher!! I want to see more videos of yours. Thanks for your service🙇', 0.5930268150386624),
    ('thank you, I really appreciate your works and support. can&#39;t wait next video.', 0.5906926818452719)
]
----

That looks pretty good to me - all of those comments are saying that they enjoyed the video.

== Cluster the embeddings

Next, we're going to cluster the embeddings so that the embeddings for similar comments are near to each other in embedding space.
We'll be using plot.ly and scikit-learn, so let's install those libraries:

[source, bash]
----
pip install plotly scikit-learn
----

There are a variety of clustering techniques that we could use, one of which is hierarchical clustering, a technique that builds a hierarchy of clusters. 
plot.ly has a `create_dendrogram` function that performs hierarchical clustering and renders the resulting tree.
Let's give that a try:

[source, python]
----
import plotly.figure_factory as ff
import numpy as np

fig = ff.create_dendrogram(np.array(embeddings))
fig.update_layout(width=1500, height=1000)
fig.show()
----

The resulting diagram is shown below:

.Hierarchical clustering
image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2024/02/cluster.png[width=500]

The cluster breaks into two at the top level, but there are a lot more values on the left-hand side.
If we go down one more level on each side, we end up with 6 clusters, which looks like it might be a good way of cutting the data.

It's kinda hard to know exactly what the right number of clusters should be, but let's start with 6 and see how we go.
We can create cluster labels for each embedding using the following scikit-learn code:

[source, python]
----
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, cut_tree, dendrogram
from collections import defaultdict 

# Compute cluster labels
complete_clustering = linkage(embeddings, method="complete", metric="cosine")
cluster_labels = cut_tree(complete_clustering, n_clusters=6).reshape(-1, )

# Create a label -> comments dictionary
groups = defaultdict(list) 
for id, label in zip(all_comments, cluster_labels):
    groups[label].append(id)
----

Let's have a look at what's in each cluster:

[source, python]
----
for k,v in groups.items():
    print(f"Cluster: {k} ({len(v)})")
    print(v[:5])
----

.Output

Cluster: 5 (1)
['keep up']
----

Cluster 0 seems to be people asking Matt to do a video about vector databases and Cluster 4 is about Google's Gemma model, but (at least from 5 comments) it's not obvious to me what the other clusters contain.
There's also a big difference in the number of items in each cluster, which doesn't help.

If we put the clustering code into a function, we can play around with different cluster sizes more easily:

[source, python]
----
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import linkage, cut_tree, dendrogram
from collections import defaultdict

def compute_clusters(n_clusters=3):
    complete_clustering = linkage(embeddings, method="complete", metric="cosine")
    cluster_labels = cut_tree(complete_clustering, n_clusters=n_clusters).reshape(-1, )

    groups = defaultdict(list) 
    for id, label in zip(all_comments, cluster_labels):
        groups[label].append(id)
    return groups, cluster_labels
----

This function also returns the cluster labels, because we'll need those in the next section.

We can call the function like this:

[source, python]
----
for k,v in compute_clusters(n_clusters=9)[0].items():
    print(f"Cluster: {k} ({len(v)})")
    print(v[:5])

Cluster: 8 (1)

----

Now the comments about making a video on vector databases have moved into Cluster 1 and Cluster 0 is people asking if the generated embeddings are any good.
Cluster 2 is people asking for code and a longer tutorial. 
Cllustr 6 has the bunnies and Cluster 7 still has no love for Gemma.

I think 9 clusters is doing a better job at pulling out the types of comments than 6 was doing, but we could certainly play around with other values.

== Visualise the embeddings

Finally, we're going to visualise the embeddings along with their labels.
To visualise the data we need to reduce the number of dimensions in the embeddings to either 2 or 3 dimensions, otherwise it'll be too hard for our poor human eyes to understand what's going on!

As with clustering, there are many algorithms to do this.
One of the best known is called t-SNE or T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, which has an implementation in scikit-learn.

The t-SNE documentation suggests that we should first reduce the dimensionality of our vectors to 50 before using it to reduce noise and speed up computation.
We've only got 100 vectors so I don't think speed will be an issue.
We'll live a bit on the wild side and feed the embeddings straight in. 

[source, python]
----

tsne = TSNE(n_components=2, verbose=1)
tsne_results = tsne.fit_transform(np.array(embeddings))

fig = go.Figure(data=go.Scatter(

    y=df['y'],
    marker=dict(color=df['label'], size=15),
    mode='markers',

fig.show()

You can see an animated version of the clusters below:

.Clusters of comments

And then I've done some manual annotation of the clusters in the following diagram:

.Annotated clusters
image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2024/02/annotated-clusters.png[width=500]

== What next?

Hopefully that's shown you some interesting ways that we can use embeddings to make sense of YouTube comments, but there are certainly more things that we can do.
Some things off the top of my head:

* Use a large language model to come up with cluster labels
* Give a large language model the clusters + comments and ask it to evaluate the clusters. Or maybe we could even get the LLM to do the clustering for us?
* Try out some different clustering methods and dimensionality reduction techniques 
* Put all of this into an interactive application so that we can iterate on different approaches more easily
