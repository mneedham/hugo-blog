rerankers[https://github.com/answerdotai/rerankers^] provides a unified API for various reranking models, including any that use transformers, FlashRank, RankGPT, RankLLM, and more.
In this blog, we'll take it for a spin.

[NOTE]
====
I've created a video showing how to do this on https://www.youtube.com/@learndatawithmark[my YouTube channel, Learn Data with Mark^], so if you prefer to consume content through that medium, I've embedded it below:

But first, let's remind ourselves what reranking is.
A basic RAG pipeline would look like this:

image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2024/09/rag.png[]

In other words, we find relevant documents from a database usually using semantic/vector search, and then we include those documents in the prompt sent to an LLM.
Reranking adds in an extra step, such that we retrieve more documents than we need from the database, ask a reranker to sort those documents, and then include the top <n> in the prompt sent to an LLM.

Let's see how to do this with rerankers.

== Installing rerankers

I'm going to use one of the Mixed Bread reranker models, which are available on Hugging Face and therefore via the transformers library.
We can install rerankers with transformers dependencies like this:

[source, bash]
----
pip install "rerankers[transformers]" torch
----

== A re-ranking Hello World

Let's import the library:

[source, python]
----
from rerankers import Reranker
----

And initialise a model:

[source, python]
----
ranker = Reranker(
  model_name='mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-large-v1',
  model_type='cross-encoder',
  device='mps'
)
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
Loading TransformerRanker model mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-large-v1
No dtype set
Using dtype torch.float16
Loaded model mixedbread-ai/mxbai-rerank-large-v1
Using device mps.
Using dtype torch.float16.
----

Let's now give it a try on a simple example.
Our search term is `I love you` and we'll rank a series of documents that have varying similarity to that phrase:

[source, python]
----
sorted_rows = ranker.rank(
  query="I love you",
  docs=["I hate you", "I really like you", "You're not too bad"],
  doc_ids=[0,1,2]
)
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
RankedResults(
    results=[
        Result(document=Document(text='I really like you', doc_id=1, metadata={}), score=-1.5400390625, rank=1),
        Result(document=Document(text="You're not too bad", doc_id=2, metadata={}), score=-2.8828125, rank=2),
        Result(document=Document(text='I hate you', doc_id=0, metadata={}), score=-4.30859375, rank=3)
    ],
    query='I love you',
    has_scores=True
)
----

That looks good - it's the same order I would have come up with!

== Re-ranking the Olympics opening ceremony

I've been playing around for a while now with a little dataset that I created from a BBC article about the Olympics Opening ceremony.
One of the questions that I've so far been unable to correctly answer with vector search, full-text search, and hybrid search, is 'What went wrong?'.
I want it to identify the arson attacks the night before the ceremony and Zidane's metro train breaking down. 
Let's see if we can do it!

We'll initialise a connection to our DuckDB database


[source, python]
----
import duckdb
con = duckdb.connect("olympics.duckdb")
----

[NOTE]
====
You can https://github.com/mneedham/LearnDataWithMark/tree/main/rerankers-playground[download the database^] from the https://github.com/mneedham/LearnDataWithMark/tree/main[mneedham/LearnDataWithMark^] GitHub repository.
====


Let's take a quick look at some of the data:

[source, python]
----
con.query("FROM olympics SELECT index, text").limit(10)
----

.Output
[source, text]
----
┌───────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ int64 │                               varchar                                │

And now for the query!
I've created a `Search`[https://github.com/mneedham/LearnDataWithMark/blob/main/rerankers-playground/search.py^] class that runs a vector search query to find the most similar text to a given query.

[source, python]
----
from search import Search
s = Search(con)

question = "What things went wrong?"
rows = s.vector_search(question, limit=10).fetchall()
----

.Output
[source, text]

The rows that I want are down in positions 4 and 5. 
I usually return just the first 3 results, so those ones would be excluded. 

Let's see if the re-ranker can help us out:

[source, python]
----
sorted_rows = ranker.rank(
  query=question,
  docs=[r[0] for r in rows],
  doc_ids=[r[1] for r in rows]
)
sorted_rows.top_k(3)
----

.Output
[source, text]

        document=Document(

            doc_id=4,
            metadata={}
        ),
        score=0.0321044921875,

        ),
        score=-0.12066650390625,
        rank=2
    ),
    Result(

        score=-0.9423828125,

    )

It can indeed!
