As I http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/01/27/pythonnumpy-selecting-specific-column-in-2d-array/[mentioned in my previous post] I've been playing around with http://www.numpy.org/[numpy] and I wanted to get the values of a collection of different indices in a 2D array.

If we had a 2D array that looked like this:

[source,python]
----

>>> x = arange(20).reshape(4,5)
>>> x
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
       [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],
       [10, 11, 12, 13, 14],
       [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]])
----

I knew that it was possible to retrieve the first 3 rows by using the following code:

[source,python]
----

>>> x[0:3]
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
       [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],
       [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]])
----

What I wanted to do, however, was retrieve the 1st, 3rd and 4th rows which we can do by passing a collection to the array lookup function:

[source,python]
----

>>> x[[0,2,3]]
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
       [10, 11, 12, 13, 14],
       [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]])
----

My collection of indices was actually in a tuple so I needed to use the +++<cite>+++http://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#list[list]+++</cite>+++ function to convert it to the appropriate data structure first:

[source,python]
----

>>> x[list((0,2,3))]
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
       [10, 11, 12, 13, 14],
       [15, 16, 17, 18, 19]])
----

Pretty neat!
