When I first started working at http://www.uswitch.com/[uSwitch] https://twitter.com/siddharthdawara[Sid] installed a couple of 'productivity applications' on my Mac which I've found pretty useful but from talking to others I realised they aren't known/being used by everyone.

== Alfred

http://www.alfredapp.com/[Alfred] is a http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksilver_(software)[Quick Silver] replacement which allows you to quickly open applications, find files, search Google and more. Even though we're not using half of its features it's still proved to be useful.

I quite like the calculator feature which we've been using for adhoc calculation like working out http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/04/10/awk-parsing-free-m-output-to-get-memory-usageconsumption/[how much free memory there was on a server] or the http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2013/04/28/ab-testing-reporting/[conversion rate on part of an A/B test].

== Moom

The other application is http://manytricks.com/moom/[Moom] which allows you to move/resize windows.

I didn't see the point when I first saw it but it's actually really useful when you're working on a big monitor and want to put say the terminal alongside the browser.

We have the following shortcuts set up:

That allows us to type 'Ctrl + Space' to make the window fill the left hand side of the screen, 'Alt + Space' to make it fill the right hand side of the screen and 'Alt + Ctrl + Space' to fill the whole screen.

You can also set up shortcuts to allow you to move a window between displays or to rearrange the windows based on certain events.

Highly recommended!

If anyone knows any other cool tools like this I'd love to hear about them.
