I wrote earlier in the year about http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2012/01/22/playing-around-with-pomodoros/[my use of pomodoros to track what I'm doing outside of work] and having done this for 6 months I noticed that I'm now procrastinating over picking something off the list to work on.

_(I know...I am awesome!)_

I'm not sure whether this is because I don't have anything really appealing on the list of things to work on or whether having so many things listed (I have 8-10 items) is causing the paralysis.

Either way it's a bit frustrating to achieve nothing in an evening because of something so ridiculous.

To outwit myself I decided to press the 'Start' button on the timer one day without picking something to work on and hoped that this would snap me out of my paralysis.

It's a relatively simple tweak but somehow seeing the time count down has the required effect and I've usually picked what I'm going to do within 30 seconds or so.

So if you are as good at procrastinating as me maybe you can try this too!
