title="Neo4j: Using LOAD CSV to process csv.gz files from S3"

I've been building some training material for the https://graphconnect.com/[GraphConnect^] conference that happens in a couple of weeks time and I wanted to load gzipped CSV files.
I got this working using Cypher's LOAD CSV command with the file stored locally, but when I uploaded it to S3 it didn't work as I expected.

I uploaded the file to an S3 bucket and then tried to read it back like this:

[source, cypher]
----
load csv with headers from "https://guides.neo4j.com/listings/data/nyc/listings.csv.gz" AS row
return row
LIMIT 1
----

I was expecting to get back a map of key/value pairs, but instead I got this:

[source, text]

After a bit of reading, I realised that the problem is to do with the meta data associated with the file.
On initial upload it had `Content-Type` set to `application-x-gzip`.

image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2018/09/default_metadata.png[]

We want the file to be processed as if it's a CSV file, so to start with we need to change that to `text/csv`.
But that isn't quite enough as I found out by changing that value and running the command again!

We also need to set `Content-Encoding` to `gzip`, something that I learnt that from Vince Veselosky's https://gist.github.com/veselosky/9427faa38cee75cd8e27[handy gist^]

Our meta data should now look like this:

image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2018/09/metadata.png[]

And if we run our query again we get more familiar output:

[source, text]
