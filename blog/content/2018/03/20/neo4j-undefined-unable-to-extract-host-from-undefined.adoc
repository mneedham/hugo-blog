During a training session I facilitated today one of the attendees got the following error message while trying to execute a query inside the Neo4j Desktop.

This error message happens if we try to run a query when the database hasn't been started, and would usually be accompanied by this screen:

On this occasion that wasn't happening, but we can easily fix it by going back to the project screen and starting the database:

image::{{<siteurl>}}/uploads/2018/03/2018-03-20_17-58-54.png[width="600px"]

Once we do that we'll be able to execute queries again.
