I've been writing the https://neo4j.com/tag/twin4j/[TWIN4j blog] for almost a year now and during that time I've written a few different http://asciidoc.org/chunked/ch21.html[asciidoc macros] to avoid repetition.

The most recent one I wrote does the formatting around the Featured Community Member of the Week. I call it like this from the asciidoc, passing in the name of the person and a link to an image:

[source,text]
----

featured::https://s3.amazonaws.com/dev.assets.neo4j.com/wp-content/uploads/20180202004247/this-week-in-neo4j-3-february-2018.jpg[name="Suellen Stringer-Hye"]

The code for the macro has two parts. The first is some wiring code that registers the macro with Asciidoctor:

+++<cite>+++lib/featured-macro.rb+++</cite>+++

[source,ruby]
----

RUBY_ENGINE == 'opal' ? (require 'featured-macro/extension') : (require_relative 'featured-macro/extension')

Asciidoctor::Extensions.register do
  if (@document.basebackend? 'html') && (@document.safe < SafeMode::SECURE)
    block_macro FeaturedBlockMacro
  end
end
----

And this is the code for the macro itself:

+++<cite>+++lib/featured-macro/extension.rb+++</cite>+++

[source,ruby]
----

require 'asciidoctor/extensions' unless RUBY_ENGINE == 'opal'

include ::Asciidoctor

class FeaturedBlockMacro < Extensions::BlockMacroProcessor
  use_dsl

  named :featured

  def process parent, target, attrs
    name = attrs["name"]

    html = %(<div class="imageblock image-heading">
                <div class="content">
                    <img src="#{target}" alt="#{name} - This Weekâ€™s Featured Community Member" width="800" height="400">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p style="font-size: .8em; line-height: 1.5em;" align="center">
              <strong>#{name} - This Week's Featured Community Member</strong>
            </p>
)

    create_pass_block parent, html, attrs, subs: nil
  end
end
----

When we convert the asciidoc into HTML we need to tell asciidoctor about the macro, which we can do like this:

[source,bash]
----

asciidoctor template.adoc \
  -r ./lib/featured-macro.rb \
  -o -
----

And that's it!
